Short scene about Betty being alone at home the day after she discovers there may
be something wrong
WC - 

Betty was still dozing when she heard the sound of the shower. Steve was getting
himself ready for work. She lay there and felt the stickiness between her thighs.
She blinked her eyes and glanced over at the clock. She could feel the inner push
to get up and join him as normally she would be going to work too she remembered
that she didn't have to. She licked the back of her teeth and realised that she
hadn't cleaned her teeth the previous night. Now she felt dirty but not in a sexy
way. She pulled back the duvet and strolled into the bathroom. The steam wafted 
out and with it the smell of the shower gel. Steve was singing. Obviously in a 
good mood. He turned off the water and was reaching for the towel. Betty handed
it to him. He dried his face and then gave her a kiss. She returned a bleary-eyed
smile.
"Morning", she said,"you're so bright this morning. He continued to dry himself
and looked at her reflection in the mirror. He wiped part of the mirror to make
her clearer and to see himself. As he filled the sink for his shave and lathered
his face he told her why he was feeling in such a positive mood.
"Betty, don't take this the wrong way, 'cos I don't mean disrespect to your 
sister but after our conversation with Eric yesterday I just feel so lucky to
have you." He paused as stetched his cheek and aimed the razor. A straight razor
which he had just stropped. He pinched his nose with his left hand and shaved his
above upper lip. He rinsed his razor and continued.
"We still got each other and we're about to get married. I mean hell, we're just
lucky to be alive after these damn attacks. So many didn't make it."
He changed hands and shaved his left cheek and then the throat. He rinsed the
razor again and then his whole face. Relathered. Started from the throat upwards
shaving against the grain this time.
"It's made me realise that we can go at any time. We just don't know when. I mean
who the hell would have expected an airplane to come crashing into the World Trade
Center. All those lives. Just cut off. You know. Gone. And it could easily have
you or me."
Betty was listening but had sat down to use the toilet. She didn't feel that he
was disrespecting Anne, in fact she thought that what he was saying addressed 
what she herself had been feeling but unable to articulate. She wrapped the paper
around her fingers and tore it from the roll. when she stood up to flush Steve
was emptying the sink and rinsing off the last of the lather. 
"Not bad, not bad at all", he said looking at himself in the close-up mirror. 
Betty stroked his cheek and kissed it. He put on a shy smile and turned towards
her. She smiled back and stroked his head. He pulled her close and hugged her.
They stayed like that for a long while. Then he pulled away.
"I never want to take any of this for granted. I don't want to complain about 
the things that are wrong in our lives only to stay focused on the positive, that
we have each other. We have our health and we're not broke. And we have our whole
lives ahead of us. I want that to always be in the forefront of my mind. If that
makes me one of those cheesy happy smiley people who seem to be up no matter what
then so be it, I don't care. But we have to make the most of this before it's 
taken away from us."
Steve picked up his watch to put on his wrist.
"Oh shit! I need to get going", he said, "better grab some coffee".
