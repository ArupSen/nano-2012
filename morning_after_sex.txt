Short scene about Betty being alone at home the day after she discovers there may
be something wrong
WC - 

Betty was still dozing when she heard the sound of the shower. Steve was getting
himself ready for work. She lay there and felt the stickiness between her thighs.
She blinked her eyes and glanced over at the clock. She could feel the inner push
to get up and join him as normally she would be going to work too she remembered
that she didn't have to. She licked the back of her teeth and realised that she
hadn't cleaned her teeth the previous night. Now she felt dirty but not in a sexy
way. She pulled back the duvet and strolled into the bathroom. The steam wafted 
out and with it the smell of the shower gel. Steve was singing. Obviously in a 
good mood. He turned off the water and was reaching for the towel. Betty handed
it to him. He dried his face and then gave her a kiss. She returned a bleary-eyed
smile.
"Morning", she said,"you're so bright this morning. He continued to dry himself
and looked at her reflection in the mirror. He wiped part of the mirror to make
her clearer and to see himself. As he filled the sink for his shave and lathered
his face he told her why he was feeling in such a positive mood.
"Betty, don't take this the wrong way, 'cos I don't mean disrespect to your 
sister but after our conversation with Eric yesterday I just feel so lucky to
have you." He paused as stetched his cheek and aimed the razor. A straight razor
which he had just stropped. He pinched his nose with his left hand and shaved his
above upper lip. He rinsed his razor and continued.
"We still got each other and we're about to get married. I mean hell, we're just
lucky to be alive after these damn attacks. So many didn't make it."
He changed hands and shaved his left cheek and then the throat. He rinsed the
razor again and then his whole face. Relathered. Started from the throat upwards
shaving against the grain this time.
"It's made me realise that we can go at any time. We just don't know when. I mean
who the hell would have expected an airplane to come crashing into the World Trade
Center. All those lives. Just cut off. You know. Gone. And it could easily have
you or me."
Betty was listening but had sat down to use the toilet. She didn't feel that he
was disrespecting Anne, in fact she thought that what he was saying addressed 
what she herself had been feeling but unable to articulate. She wrapped the paper
around her fingers and tore it from the roll. when she stood up to flush Steve
was emptying the sink and rinsing off the last of the lather. 
"Not bad, not bad at all", he said looking at himself in the close-up mirror. 
Betty stroked his cheek and kissed it. He put on a shy smile and turned towards
her. She smiled back and stroked his head. He pulled her close and hugged her.
They stayed like that for a long while. Then he pulled away.
"I never want to take any of this for granted. I don't want to complain about 
the things that are wrong in our lives only to stay focused on the positive, that
we have each other. We have our health and we're not broke. And we have our whole
lives ahead of us. I want that to always be in the forefront of my mind. If that
makes me one of those cheesy happy smiley people who seem to be up no matter what
then so be it, I don't care. But we have to make the most of this before it's 
taken away from us."
Steve picked up his watch to put on his wrist.
"Oh shit! I need to get going", he said, "better grab some coffee".
Even if he wasn't going to eat he was going to have coffee. He could easily get
a pastry at work and probably have another coffee. He managed to finish getting
dressed while the coffee brewed and drank it in a few mouthfuls before saying his
goodbyes and getting out the door. Betty followed him into the kitchen while he
did his final preparations. She thought about what he had said as the door 
closed behind him and she was all alone. It was quiet and empty and there were 
no tasks ahead of her aside from general maintenance. She stopped staring at the
door and went back to the bathroom and stepped into the shower. The steam had 
only just started to clear and now it was coming back. After a few moments she
found that she was just standing there without actually washing or moving. There
was nothing wrong with that except that the bathtub was a much better way of 
achieving that. She turned off the shower and started to fill the tub. She went
back to the kitchen and found that there was still some coffee left over. It 
was fresh so she poured it out and took it back to the bathroom. She took the 
newspapers from the previous day and put them on a chair next to the bathtub.
She wiped the mirror and combed her hair. She wondered who she was. A victim of
a wounded city. The bath was almost full so she turned off the taps. No nausea
today or a headache. What about the breast? She drew back the bathrobe and put
her right hand up to it. Still looked inflamed but there wasn't any tenderness
as there was the previous day. The nipple looked weird though but only very
slightly. She put it down to a heavy hangover coupled with grief. Perhaps the
general malaise of the city was working its way through all of its inhabitants.
As long as she could ascribe it to something it didn't matter. But nothing that
would require any form of treatment stronger than an aspirin or rest. The pain
was gone so she stopped worrying, slipped of her robe and stepped into the tub.
It was a teeny bit too hot but that's how she liked it. If it was just right
now then in a few minutes the water would cool down and she would get used to
it and then it would feel too cold. So it was better to start with it just a 
little too warm then the effect of her body cooling the water and her growing
accustomed to the temperature meant that she could stay in her comfort zone 
for much longer. Once her whole body was in the water she reached across to
the chair and picked up the coffee and took some big sips. Only warm now. Then
one very big sip to finish the cup. She put it back and then took one of the
papers and folded it up so that she could read it without getting it wet. She
skimmed the headlines for an article that might interest her but it was all
related to the aftermath of the Trade Center attacks. She tried to find things
that she hadn't seen the day before but there wasn't much. She put down the 
papers as she was wanting to get her arms and hands into the water. She sank
lower till only her face was out of the water and she could hear heart beating.
She could also hear herself breathing. She could feel she shockwave of the 
heartbeat echo through her whole body, rippling from the centre outwards. No
movement apart from these vital organs. Her metaphorical heart seemed to be
frozen in time. Instead of water that could have been ice. Her mind began to
spring into action once more and she remembered what Steve had said about the
fact that he didn't want to take anything for granted. Especially not her and
what they had. But what did they have? Was it really special? Was it not just
something that everyone has? And what about her? what did she want? How did
she feel? Her process didn't feel as linear or as textbook as Steves or as
Erics. 
All these ideas played themselves out in her mind as she lay motionless in the
tub being acutely aware of her heart and lungs as well as the sound of the 
drop of water falling from the tap. She could see the steam rising from the
surface of the water and could feel her problems evaporate and merge with the
rest of the steam in the room.
She started to think about her wedding: it was coming soon. She was going to
marry the man she loved. Did she love him? Yes she did. But did she trust him?
She wasn't sure. She hadn't told him about the little turn that she'd had and
she needed to talk about it. No she didn't. Why was there a need to talk about
something that was so much of nothing. He would get all worried and he would
want her to go to the hospital and there would be so much fussing and how they
were in it together and that they would see it through. No, she didn't want any
of that. And besides it was nothing. This morning it was all gone. No pain in 
her breast, no nausea and no headache. The nipple did look a bit wierd and so
she had hidden that away. But no big deal; it would sort itself out. Only a
hiccup. But Steve could easily have made it more than it was. That was all. It
wasn't that she didn't trust him, it was more a case of letting minor things
remain on the periphery of her life while she got on with the big stuff. Focus
on the main goals in her life. But what were they? Getting married? Having a 
child? Climbing the career ladder? Were they her goals or were they everyones
goals and she'd just bought into them? I mean she did want those things but did
she want them because she ought to want them? Anne didn't really want those 
things. She couldn't have got married. She would have had no time for children
unless she changed job and she was so dedicated that she would never have never
have changed job. And climbing the career ladder would have meant she wouldn't
be seeing the action. She was exactly where she wanted to be. Her goal wasn't 
to improve herself or her life but simply to maintain. She had no plans to go
on holiday or developing new skills apart from those that might improve her
ability to be more effective when she arrived on the scence. Anne's life seemed
so clear. She was respected and what she did was honourable. She was exempt from
having to pursue those goals that others were expected to have. Was that all it
was then? Expectation? Were people simply expected to improve their careers, 
get married and have children? Betty tried hard but she couldn't really separate
the two. On the one hand she did want to improve her career at least in terms 
of her earnings and handle the bigger clients she thought. She did want to have
children and she also wanted to get married. But were they what she herself 
wanted or what was expected of her? She couldn't really figure that one out. Had
she simply absorbed a collective goal and made it hers? So in actual fact it was
not really her plan or ambition but one that belonged to society and she being 
part of that society was championing their cause but at the same time being 
blind to her own individual needs and wants. Was that the case? Had she made a
sacrifice without even knowing that she had? Had society duped her into thinking
that what she wanted now was not a collective dream, the American dream or at 
least the dream that was shared within her peer group? If that was the case then
the group or the world had managed to pull over her eyes for a long time. She 
started to get a little irritated that this could actually be true. But why 
would society at large create such an illusion and get everyone to buy into it?
Industry? Something to keep the workers happy so that the fatcats could have a
lifelong slave.  
Betty realised that her thoughts had taken a turn that was subversive and that
if she continued in that line of argument then it could easily spiral out of 
control. Best to leave her mental meanderings at that point go out for a run.
The water was starting to get cold anyway. She got changed into her running gear
and out to Washington Square Park. It was a sunny morning but a cold yet 
stalwart mood still prevailed. The city had been hit hard but the inhabitants
were not going to cower in fright. They all got on with their lives standing 
proud. She ran at an easy pace going a touch faster when she felt the irritation
rising in her. She was a regular runner so she wasn't worried about overdoing it
or getting out of breath. Her plan was to run for half an hour or so and then 
get a snack in the park. If she felt like continuing her run after that time 
that was OK too. She felt reasonably fit in spite of having taken the previous
day off and a spell of heavy drinking. She was wearing a sports bra but could 
still feel a slight something in her left breast. She put it down to her 
imagination or that it wasn't fitting properly that morning. But it was slight
enough for her to ignore it. After about 40 minutes she decided to take a rest
and eat a hot dog. She ate about half of it and realised that she wasn't too
hungry after all. She sat on the bench for a little wondering what Anne would
be doing if she were alive right now. Doing what mattered and doing what mattered
to her.
