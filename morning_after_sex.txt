Short scene about Betty being alone at home the day after she discovers there may
be something wrong
WC - 

Betty was still dozing when she heard the sound of the shower. Steve was getting
himself ready for work. She lay there and felt the stickiness between her thighs.
She blinked her eyes and glanced over at the clock. She could feel the inner push
to get up and join him as normally she would be going to work too she remembered
that she didn't have to. She licked the back of her teeth and realised that she
hadn't cleaned her teeth the previous night. Now she felt dirty but not in a sexy
way. She pulled back the duvet and strolled into the bathroom. The steam wafted 
out and with it the smell of the shower gel. Steve was singing. Obviously in a 
good mood. He turned off the water and was reaching for the towel. Betty handed
it to him. He dried his face and then gave her a kiss. She returned a bleary-eyed
smile.
"Morning", she said,"you're so bright this morning. He continued to dry himself
and looked at her reflection in the mirror. He wiped part of the mirror to make
her clearer and to see himself. As he filled the sink for his shave and lathered
his face he told her why he was feeling in such a positive mood.
"Betty, don't take this the wrong way, 'cos I don't mean disrespect to your 
sister but after our conversation with Eric yesterday I just feel so lucky to
have you." He paused as stetched his cheek and aimed the razor. A straight razor
which he had just stropped. He pinched his nose with his left hand and shaved his
above upper lip. He rinsed his razor and continued.
"We still got each other and we're about to get married. I mean hell, we're just
lucky to be alive after these damn attacks. So many didn't make it."
He changed hands and shaved his left cheek and then the throat. He rinsed the
razor again and then his whole face. Relathered. Started from the throat upwards
shaving against the grain this time.
"It's made me realise that we can go at any time. We just don't know when. I mean
who the hell would have expected an airplane to come crashing into the World Trade
Center. All those lives. Just cut off. You know. Gone. And it could easily have
you or me."
Betty was listening but had sat down to use the toilet. She didn't feel that he
was disrespecting Anne, in fact she thought that what he was saying addressed 
what she herself had been feeling but unable to articulate. She wrapped the paper
around her fingers and tore it from the roll. when she stood up to flush Steve
was emptying the sink and rinsing off the last of the lather. 
"Not bad, not bad at all", he said looking at himself in the close-up mirror. 
Betty stroked his cheek and kissed it. He put on a shy smile and turned towards
her. She smiled back and stroked his head. He pulled her close and hugged her.
They stayed like that for a long while. Then he pulled away.
"I never want to take any of this for granted. I don't want to complain about 
the things that are wrong in our lives only to stay focused on the positive, that
we have each other. We have our health and we're not broke. And we have our whole
lives ahead of us. I want that to always be in the forefront of my mind. If that
makes me one of those cheesy happy smiley people who seem to be up no matter what
then so be it, I don't care. But we have to make the most of this before it's 
taken away from us."
Steve picked up his watch to put on his wrist.
"Oh shit! I need to get going", he said, "better grab some coffee".
Even if he wasn't going to eat he was going to have coffee. He could easily get
a pastry at work and probably have another coffee. He managed to finish getting
dressed while the coffee brewed and drank it in a few mouthfuls before saying his
goodbyes and getting out the door. Betty followed him into the kitchen while he
did his final preparations. She thought about what he had said as the door 
closed behind him and she was all alone. It was quiet and empty and there were 
no tasks ahead of her aside from general maintenance. She stopped staring at the
door and went back to the bathroom and stepped into the shower. The steam had 
only just started to clear and now it was coming back. After a few moments she
found that she was just standing there without actually washing or moving. There
was nothing wrong with that except that the bathtub was a much better way of 
achieving that. She turned off the shower and started to fill the tub. She went
back to the kitchen and found that there was still some coffee left over. It 
was fresh so she poured it out and took it back to the bathroom. She took the 
newspapers from the previous day and put them on a chair next to the bathtub.
She wiped the mirror and combed her hair. She wondered who she was. A victim of
a wounded city. The bath was almost full so she turned off the taps. No nausea
today or a headache. What about the breast? She drew back the bathrobe and put
her right hand up to it. Still looked inflamed but there wasn't any tenderness
as there was the previous day. The nipple looked weird though but only very
slightly. She put it down to a heavy hangover coupled with grief. Perhaps the
general malaise of the city was working its way through all of its inhabitants.
As long as she could ascribe it to something it didn't matter. But nothing that
would require any form of treatment stronger than an aspirin or rest. The pain
was gone so she stopped worrying, slipped of her robe and stepped into the tub.
It was a teeny bit too hot but that's how she liked it. If it was just right
now then in a few minutes the water would cool down and she would get used to
it and then it would feel too cold. So it was better to start with it just a 
little too warm then the effect of her body cooling the water and her growing
accustomed to the temperature meant that she could stay in her comfort zone 
for much longer. Once her whole body was in the water she reached across to
the chair and picked up the coffee and took some big sips. Only warm now. Then
one very big sip to finish the cup. She put it back and then took one of the
papers and folded it up so that she could read it without getting it wet. She
skimmed the headlines for an article that might interest her but it was all
related to the aftermath of the Trade Center attacks. She tried to find things
that she hadn't seen the day before but there wasn't much. She put down the 
papers as she was wanting to get her arms and hands into the water. She sank
lower till only her face was out of the water and she could hear heart beating.
She could also hear herself breathing. She could feel she shockwave of the 
heartbeat echo through her whole body, rippling from the centre outwards. No
movement apart from these vital organs. Her metaphorical heart seemed to be
frozen in time. Instead of water that could have been ice. Her mind began to
spring into action once more and she remembered what Steve had said about the
fact that he didn't want to take anything for granted. Especially not her and
what they had. But what did they have? Was it really special? Was it not just
something that everyone has? And what about her? what did she want? How did
she feel? Her process didn't feel as linear or as textbook as Steves or as
Erics. 
All these ideas played themselves out in her mind as she lay motionless in the
tub being acutely aware of her heart and lungs as well as the sound of the 
drop of water falling from the tap. She could see the steam rising from the
surface of the water and could feel her problems evaporate and merge with the
rest of the steam in the room.
