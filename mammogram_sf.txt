Trudy had booked an appointment at a hospital in San Francisco to get a second
opinion on her cancer diagnosis
WC - 3013 

The day after the Taekwondo class both Betty and Trudy went back to their normal
routines. Trudy was meditating in her room and Betty went out for a run. She 
feel that she had worked the previous day. Her shoulders were aching from holding
her arms in the air from punches and blocks and her legs were aching from all 
the streches. It was a warm day for that time of year and Betty found herself a
little overdressed for her run. She unzipped the top and tied the sleeves around
her waist. She ran past Bodega Bay and Captain Joe's. Her usual route. When she
had set out her plan was to run further than usual but she was finding it too
hot and her energy was used up from the Taekwondo class. She had enjoyed and she
had also learned something about her friend that she didn't know before. She had
planned to mull over some of these things during her run but as she didn't have 
the energy today she opted for a coffee at Captain Joe's. Joe greeted her warmly
and she ordered a coffee and a glass of water. There were 9-5 ers getting their
morning coffee and pastry. Betty got the table by the window as it was free and
didn't mind when a couple of guys asked if they could share. She sipped her 
coffee and looked at the sea through the window. It was so calm today.

Would Trudy really kill this guy? Had she been training specifically for revenge?
People did that. Sure they did. But someone that she knew? Was that possible. Her
own problems had moved into the background she was focused on Trudy. But what 
about all the holistic lifestyle that she lived? Was it all just to contain her
anger and agression. She was hitting that pad pretty hard. Betty couldn't figure
it out. If someone had beat up Steve would she take up martial arts and think
about revenge? But something happens during grief, something very powerful and
it gives you a sense of direction that you feel compelled to follow. It's as 
though a portal opens and you see something that you had never seen before and
what you see seems to cut through how you used to see the world. Your previous
way of looking at things seems naive at best. You chide yourself for having 
looked at the world in that way for so long and realise that there is no time
to waste and start following your own plan. Whether the new sense of clarity is
only a slightly clearer than the previous world view or a lot clearer depends
on the person experiencing the vision but Betty could see that Trudy was on a
path that was borne out of her grief just as she herself was on a new path borne
out of her own grief. Her own path seemed to be more of a philosophical one 
rather than a physical one.

Once she had come to this conclusion the finished up her coffee and then drank
down the glass of water. She smiled at the man sitting next to her who was 
talking to his friend. He got up immediately to let her pass. At the counter
she bought a couple of apple danishes and wished Joe a good day. She walked back
to the hous rather than running. Trudy had finished her meditation and was out
on the porch. She was looking grave and worried.
"Hey. How're you feeling this morning? Aching at all?", asked Trudy.
"Yeah, a little I guess. Actually, yes. I'm pooped. Didn't have the energy to
run properly" answered Betty. She handed Trudy the pastries.
"You OK with how I was last night? I bet you weren't expecting that?" Trudy 
needed to know where Betty stood on this issue.
"I was thinking about it this morning. It just feels like you have been following
a plan and waiting to take your revenge but I can't believe you're so calculated."
"No I'm not. That's the thing. I forgot about that guy and even though I was angry
it was never my intention to go and hunt him down. Sure I wanted him dead some
of the time but that wouldn't have brought Gary back. It would only have brought
be a moment of peace or a moment of something."
"You'd be in jail", said Betty.
"Yeah, but when that feeling of revenge takes you, you don't think about the 
consequences."
"I guess not."
"I started the martial arts as a way to control and release my agression that part
was true. And when I started I wasn't capable in the way I am now. I wasn't sure
that I would have stuck with it for so long. I figured that I'd do it for a while
just to calm down, you know like a kind of therapy. Then I had all this Chinese
medicine that took up so much of my time. All that was very peaceful. But the guys
at the dojo, I mean the club really encouraged me as they could see potential so
I stuck at it. Betty, my only focus is the tournament believe me. I don't want to
hurt anyone. There is enough violence in the world. I don't want to add to it."
"OK. That makes sense. I'm not judging you or anything, it just all seemed a bit
out of place against your meditation and acupuncture."
"Sure. I guess that was another reason I wanted you to come to the class. But 
talking of acupuncture I have clients today so we can't really hang much. You're 
more than welcome to stay here but you'll need to be quiet."
Trudy prepared the breakfast things and they sat down properly.
"Gorgeous day. Feels almost like summer. Well, it's warm and sunny but not hot.
Why don't you take a trip North and check out some of the vineyards. You could 
get us a case of wine for this evening." said Trudy.
"A case? You planning on getting shitfaced?" asked Betty incredulously.
"No," laughed Trudy, "it's just that you can get decent wine at a good price so
you might as well get a case or two. They mark it up a lot at the supermarket.
You'll get some great views up there".
"How many treatments do you have?" asked Betty.
"Bout five today, maybe six, I need to check. So it's kind of a full day. A couple
in the morning then more in the late afternoon and early evening. So I'll be tied
up for most of the day. Imagine I'll be pooped by the time you get home."
"OK. Sounds like a plan. Maybe I should grab some chow on the way home. What do
you think?" asked Betty.
"Yeah, that would be great. Especially with the wine".
"My first one is in half an hour so I best start getting my shit together. You 
need a map or anything?" asked Trudy.
"No, I'm good. I'll just follow the signs, have a little adventure."
"OK, well, sorry to rush things but I'll see you later on then and you can tell
me all about it."

Betty was showered and dressed and put on her sunglasses. It was bright but not
too hot. She got in her rental car and saw another car approaching as she was
manoevering herself onto the road. That must be Trudy's first client she thought.
She remembered lying on the massage bed with the needles in her arm. Would be 
nice to have that on a regular basis. Once she was out of the residential area
of Dillon Beach and the main route to Santa Rosa she turned North as Trudy had
suggested. The road was quiet and sunny and she had just missed all the commuter
traffic. She wished that she had a convertible at this point. She put on the 
radio and cruised as she had done on her way over to Trudy's. After only forty
minutes drive she was passing signs to bodegas and winerys. She had no idea which
were the better ones, it just a case of choosing one. She decided to take the 
next exit and ended up on a dirt track leading to Los Molinos. When she arrived
at the car park there was coach party with tourists from San Francisco. She was
not really sure where to go asked one of the party. After a short conversation
with the tour leader she was invited to join them. It was a tour of the winery
with talks on its history and tasting of course. Lunch would be provided and
they would also get discounts on any purchases. She offered to pay a share but
they were all happy to have her tag along. She accepted and added her own crunchy
gravel footstep sounds. A minute later the man from Los Molinos, their host for
the day arrived and introduced himself.

They walked through a couple of fields and were told about the soil and the grape
variety. About how they had developed it. In the clear sun that day it was the
ideal destination. They were shown into the presses and the fermentation vats.
Finally into the bottling and corking area. He explained how some people still 
preferred the cork in spite of the screw cap being perfectly usable. There were
also wine boxes. There was was white, red and some rose too. Some bottles of
fortified wine and various Los Molinos tableware made by local artisans. They
produced six different varieties and exported their wine worldwide. Betty was
not much of a wine expert but she liked what she tasted. She realised why these
people had arrived on a coach: they weren't spitting. Betty made sure that she
spat. They were a very friendly group and she had lunch with a retired couple 
from San Francisco who lived near the Botanical Gardens. They'd seen this place
in a guide book in the summer and thought it would be a nice day trip. After 
lunch everyone made their purchases and the party was back on the coach crunching
on the gravel out of the car park. Betty waved them goodbye and as it was still
early she decided to take a walk. Having packed her cases of wine in her car
she drove a little further north to find a walking trail. She found more middle
aged couples with walking sticks and followed the signs. She wasn't thinking, she
wasn't worrying, just enjoying nature.

Late afternoon she started driving back to Santa Rosa. It was a short drive and
she didn't want to arrive while Trudy still had clients. She bought tofu burritos
at the wholefood diner and then headed home. She hadn't thought about anything 
today and it was a relief. A real break from herself.

She had timed it well as Trudy's last client for the day was just leaving. Trudy
waved to her as she got out of the car. She saw that Betty had luggage and went
out to help her.
"Hey. Wow, two cases. That should keep us in booze for a while. Cool, you got
burritos too. Maybe you should just stay here" she quipped.
"That's funny, I was thinking that today." said Betty, "I had such a great time
at this wine place and then I went for a walk in the hills. It was a great 
suggestion. I just felt so free and easy and didn't think about any of my shit".
Betty closed the doors and locked it before picking up her box of wine and 
followed Trudy into the house.
"Let's crack one open shall we?", said Trudy.
They poured and clicked glasses. They devoured their burritos and the food made
them drowsy. They'd both had had full days and went to bed very soon after eating.
Just as well really as the following day was Betty's hospital appointment in
San Francisco.

The hospital appointment was for 12:00 in San Francisco. It was only an hour or so
away but they decided to leave an extra half an hour for possible delays. This gave
them plenty of time to follow their morning routine. Betty went out along the beach
for her morning run while Trudy did her meditation practice. Betty returned with 
pastries from Captain Joe's and they had breakfast on the porch. Betty was a fidgety
this morning and obviously nervous. It was nearly time to leave. 
"Come on Betty, let's do this. You're not wimping out me now are you?" said Trudy
in a bit to elicit some bravado.
"Nah, I'm good." said Betty rising to the challenge. Within a few minutes they were
in the car ready to go. Betty sighed and Trudy nodded.
They didn't head towards Santa Rosa but took the Valley Ford Road and the Bodega
Road to Petaluma where they got onto Highway 101 which took them South to San
Francisco. The highway took them directly to San Francisco General Hospital in 
just under an hour. They were early. But the time got taken up looking for parking.
The parking had annoyed them both but had the effect of taking their minds off the
reason they were visiting. Betty found the map from the appointment letter and they
started to find their way. It was 11:55 when they found the right department and
there was only a small queue. There were only two people before them even though
a lot more people sitting and waiting. About a quarter of an hour later Betty's 
name was called and they both went inside. Trudy explained that she was the one
that had made the appointment on behalf of her friend who was visiting from out
of town. She explained that she had already been diagnosed but was looking for
a second opinion. The doctor was on the point of putting them through the usual
bureaucratic channels when he had a change of heart and decided to go ahead with
the examination. Betty was a bag of nerves but managed to hold herself together
with Trudy present. The doctor examined her and took a mammogram. Minutes later
he showed her the x-ray on the light box. They could all see the large white
shadow. The doctor pointed to it.
"I'm sorry to have to tell you this but that there spot is a tumour. I can see
you also have an inverted nipple and you're getting pain in your breast. There
is no way of breaking this to you gently. You have breast cancer. I don't know
what your doctor in New York told you but you need to get this treated pretty
soon."
This doctor was more direct than the one in New York but he also seemed to be
more caring.
"You feeling nauseous?"
She nodded.
"Pain in your armpit? Difficult to move your arm sometimes?"
She shook her head.
"I'm surprised that it got to such an advanced stage before you noticed anything.
But you need to act fast miss 'cos this thing is only getting bigger and it needs
to be taken out. It'll spread through your whole body and then it'll kill you. 
Modern as medical science may be we got surgery and chemo when it comes to cancer
and a whole host of alternative therapies that may or may not work. If it was me
I'd make an appointment for surgery as soon as possible before those cells start
spreading. After that we would need to do the chemo. But hey, it's your choice.
We don't put pressure on anyone to do anything but what I want to impress upon
you is that this is urgent and you need to do something about it soon."
"OK, thanks I guess" said Betty.
"There's nothing more I can tell you I'm afraid and I'm sorry to have to confirm
what you already knew. And now I'm going to have to say goodbye to you and wish
you all the best because as you will have seen, there are other waiting."
They both nodded and left the room.
"Let's get out of here", said Betty,"I feel like I need some air".
"I bet you do", said Trudy, "how about we go to the park. There's a small one
nearby. We can walk there."
"OK, yeah, that sounds good. I think we still have some minutes on the parking".
They went to Potrero del Sol park. It was a green area but surrounded by big 
roads and full of kids on skateboards. It was perfect for a short interlude.
They sat on a grassy knoll and watched the kids with their baseball caps and
baggy shirts trying to master tricks and jumps. Trudy told her that she came
here a few times when Gary was at the hospital which of course brought back 
memories of those times. After a few minutes Betty felt a little better and
she was also worried about getting a parking fine so they went back to the car
and drove to the Mission District.
"If you want to get a really good burrito then you have to come here. Santa Rosa
isn't bad but here is where it's at," said Trudy.
"How about this one?" asked Betty.
"Yeah, any one is good really", said Trudy.
After their lunch they went to Chinatown where Trudy got some herbs. 
"You can't get everything in Santa Rosa so I come here once in a while. As you
can see, they have it all." Trudy looked like a kid in a toyshop.
They did a couple of touristic visits to Haight / Ashbury and the Embarcadero.
But Betty wanted to get out of the city. It was just before the evening rush
hour so they'd be out in good time. Once they were back on the porch Betty 
heaved a sigh of relief to be back to somewhere that she called home. Trudy was
preparing another herbal infusion with the herbs she had bought. This was a follow
up to the one she had had a few days ago but now with an added ingredient which she
was missing before. Once again Betty drank it all down as though it was her 
favourite cup of coffee. They both sat and watched the waves and took in what had
happened that day.
