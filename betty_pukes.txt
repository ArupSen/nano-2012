WC - 2000

The day after Anne's funeral Betty and Steve are back in New York. It's a Sunday
and everything is fairly quiet apart from the continuing rescue efforts and 
people trying to make sense of their lives. For some the strategy is to try and
carry on as before; to go on living their lives, proud of who they were and to
remain undeterred. Both Betty and Steve advocated to this ethos being native
New Yorkers.

It was already around 11.00am and they were only just stirring. They hadn't had 
much of a late night but they had drank very heavily and saw some people they 
hadn't seen in a while. We tend to think that a funeral is for the dearly 
departed but they're gone, what do they know. Can they really complain about 
the music or the speeches or the amount of alcohol that was drunk? A funeral is
for the living ones to say goodbye. Betty knew that but now that it was someone
dear to her she was finding it hard to detatch herself from the whole thing as
she normally would. She needed it just as much as anyone else.

How was she to carry on without her little sister? Granted she didn't see much
of her but she knew that she was there and they did see each other on a regular
basis. Things would have to change. These were the trains of thought that ran
through Betty's brain as she was waking up that Sunday morning.

The moment she became aware of her body her cursive thoughts immediately 
drifted away. She had a headache, her eyes hurt and her stomach was getting 
ready to heave. Moving quickly but without any sudden movements she moved to
the toilet hoping not to wake Steve. She didn't like how he fussed about these
things. She closed the door to muffle the sound even further and then proceeded
to make four consecutive heaves taking a few breaths between each one. She was
waiting for a fifth one that didn't come. She rinsed her mouth and dried it 
before using the toilet in the usual fashion. As she sat there she could feel
her heart beating hard but feeling no better as she was expecting. Betty was
used to drinking and this was a regular occurrence but on this occasion she 
wasn't feeling the relief that followed a vomit. It was as if it felt worse.
In fact it did feel worse. There was also some pain around her left breast.
A glass of water from the kitchen while she walked clumsily and bleary eyed
back to the bedroom. She hadn't flushed the toilet to remain quiet. She smiled
to herself when she thought about the look on Steve's face when he would see
it. With this thought in mind she put down the glass on the nightstand and 
tucked herself back into bed. Steve hadn't moved and was snoring quietly.
She turned and took another sip of water before putting her head back on the
pillow and drifting back to sleep.

About an hour later Steve started to groan and heard some noise in the 
upstairs apartment. He was nauseous and felt a little pain in his stomach
but he wasn't on the point of vomiting like Betty. He was made of stronger
stuff or so he thought. He yawned and shrugged his shoulders hard while his
whole body trembled. With his eyes still half-closed he slid out of bed with
the familiarity of someone who completely trusts their home. He lifted the lid
of the toilet and his manly resolve almost broke. An ugly reminder of the night
before. Betty liked her practical jokes. He made an empty heave as he tried to
concentrate on aiming his stream of urine. He made sure to flush and put some 
bleach down too. The smell of the chlorine was almost like smelling salts and
had the effect of waking him somewhat. Made him think about that slogan that
went something like waking up and smelling the coffee. Which of course made
him think about coffee. He went straight to the kitchen and started to gather
together all the things required for making coffee. It was Sunday so no loss
of brownie points for getting up so late especially after a night like that
but he didn't want to miss the day altogether. He smelled the milk and it ok
but could have been fresher. Black coffee? No, he liked it with milk so it 
meant a trip downstairs. He could hear the rustle of the duvet and soon Betty
came out. 
"Morning", said Steve, "thanks for the lovely surprise".
Betty sniggered and put her hand to her mouth, still feeling a little delicate.
"I know you love surprises so I made it specially. Pretty good night uh?"
"Yeah. Good to see everyone", replied Steve slightly steering the conversation
in a more sombre direction.
Betty hadn't forgotten that it wasn't just another party and it wasn't a way of
celebrating that they were still around while her sister was gone. But those 
were the facts and she had to deal with the fact that her sister was gone. Only
one day to grieve at least officially. No official month of mourning but who
knew how long it would take till that feeling of deep shock would pass and live
would actually go on again.
Betty had been out of the kitchen window while she was thinking about these 
things and Steve had noticed it but hadn't mentioned it while he continued to
prepare the morning coffee.
"I'm going to go grab some milk from the store and maybe get the papers too. 
Don't really want to get dressed but I'd rather not go out in my pyjamas and
slippers. Won't be long. You want anything?", he asked.
"I was thinking about eggs but actually I'm not sure. Why don't you get some
anyways and maybe I'll have them later on. Actually, pastry. Yeah, pastry."
Steve got changed quickly and made a quick wave before closing the door. He 
wouldn't be long but it would be long enough for Betty to go to another world
and come back again. Her mind flashed through odd disjointed memories. Some of
them would last for a few moments while others would pass in an instant. She 
wrapped her dressing gown tighter around herself and went to sit on the sofa.
It was an open plan apartment and the kitchen was more of a kitchen area than
a room in it's own right. She wanted to look out of the front window so she
got up again and opened the curtains. The light was bright and hurt her eyes.
She could see Steve on the street below going into the store. She wondered
what else he might buy. She sat down again and crossed her legs and sat right
into the corner of the sofa. She now began to feel more than she thought. The
thoughts and images running through her mind were all still there but the 
emotions now came more fully into the foreground of her experience. A great 
wave of sadness washed over her and she could feel herself being saturated 
by it. Sort of comforting in a way as it was a feelling that one would expect
at such a time. Almost like a cold wind that chills you when you first leave
a warm house. But soon you get used to it and continue walking. You know it's
winter and that sooner or later you need to get out of the house. It's warm
inside but it's not real. The actual season and climate were out of doors
and you had to face it. If you were wearing the right clothes then it was fine.
Betty was wearing the right clothes and she could bear the cold wind of her
sadness. It was that particular season and until that winter ended and spring
arrived, she would feel that chill right through into her bones. She would go
inside to sleep and be with her man but only for part of the time. And as one
gets accustomed to the cold one sees the finer details like the patterns on 
the snowflake: a touch of regret, a hint of anger, confusion, jealousy but most
of all a question which asked her what now? Her sister was dead: what did that
mean? She was going to die too and all of her friends and her family. Yes, all
of them. Every one. There was nothing that she could do about it except to 
accept that it was going to happen. She only just seemed to notice that tears
had been running down her face while she was examining her feelings and letting
them wash over her. She wiped her eyes on her sleeve when she heard the key go
into the door and the sound of Steve returning.
"Guess what I got", said Steve in his best gameshow voice.
"Apple pie?" asked Betty, trying to get back into that playful state.
"I got bagels from the deli. I forgot they were open on Sundays. I got the 
papers and a few things for dinner in case we wanna stay home tonight."
Steve was trying to be organised, his way of dealing with stuff, when he didn't
want to feel the full force of the situation he was in. Be practical. But he
was feeling it all the same.
"So; coffee?" asked Steve, assumming the answer would be yes. 
"Yeah, get it on. I'm going to take a very quick shower. I think I'll have eggs
too. Starting to feel hungry now. Bagels were a great idea", Betty was out of
the door before Steve could reply.
It wasn't a quick shower at all and Betty put her face into the stream just like
they do in the movies. It was sort of comforting and not something that she ever
did but this was the kind of situation where they would do it. They usually held
it there for a while but she didn't. She let it pour onto her back and stood 
there with her eyes closed. It was warm and comforting. She didn't get dressed
but came back into the sitting room in her bath robe. 
"It's almost ready. Big table or small table?"
"Small table. I want to sit on the sofa".
"Good plan".
Coffee, orange juice, scrambled eggs on toast, bagels with smoked salmon with a
few pastries to boot. The best hangover cure was to eat and rest. Replenish and
rehydrate. The coffee table was between the sofa and the window which went all
the way from the floor to the ceiling and gave a great view of the street 
outside. They both got their feet up on the sofa and watched the steam rising 
from the coffee and the cars moving slowly on the street below. They reached 
for their cups and took a sip and continued to watch the world outside. It was
much better than watching television. 

Now that Steve was there the feelings and thoughts that had welled up in her
had all gone away. It was as though it was no longer a private space. But Steve
was her fiancee. He was her man. He was her confidante. Or that was what she 
had assummed. But it was becoming apparent to her that this was not the case.
He looked at her for a moment while she munched on a bagel and took a big sip of
coffee. She noticed and smiled. But it was almost like a strangers smile. He
noticed this too. He didn't want to force her but all he really wanted was that
she open up to him and let it all out. But all in her own time and only if that
was what was required. Practical.

As Betty continued to eat her brunch she still felt slightly nauseous and also 
a cramp in her left breast, like it was tight or bloated. She winced but didn't
want Steve to notice that she was suffering any pain. The coffee had woken her
up but there was still a slight headache. Time for some aspirin. Steve sensed 
that something was wrong. 
"You OK? You look a little peeky.", Steve was concerned but didn't want to pry.
"Think maybe I had a bit more that I thought I did", she chuckled trying to be
open with Steve but still hiding the truth she wondered if there was something
else going on other than the hangover. She was a regular drinker and she knew
her hangovers all too well. This experince was very unfamiliar.
"I'm gonna have another aspirin I think", she said walking towards the kitchen
to get some water. After she had swallowed the pills she wondered whether she
should take her experience seriously or just write it up as an anomaly.
"You wanna go see a movie", she asked trying to maintain and present an upbeat
frame of mind.
"Sure, why not. You got anything in mind?".
"Not really. Why don't we just go there and see what's on? I need a little 
entertainment but nothing too demanding", she smiled.
"Let me check the papers, there might be something on quite soon", said Steve.
While Steve got his nose into the papers Betty quietly walked back into the
bedroom and clutched her left breast and groaned as quietly as she could. It
was painful. She gently squeezed and the whole breast felt tight and a swollen.
She moved into the bathroom so as not to arouse any suspicion now that she had
managed to divert it. She turned around carefully to check that Steve hadn't 
followed her and gradually moved the robe to one side and reveal the breast in
the mirror. The area around the nipple and areola was markedly bigger on the 
left side but only if they were exposed. The swelling seemed to be mainly on
the inside. She stared at the reflection for a moment longer and then covered
herself up. Sex in the dark? No squeezing? Only from behind? She knew that 
Steve would make a big deal out of it and that was exactly what she didn't 
want. She felt a slight heave but nothing came up. Good thing too with all that
nice brunch inside her. The minor gagging had made her eyes water and she 
quickly dried them in case that revealed anything. She put the tissue into the
toilet and flushed it before returning to the living room. Steve was still 
perusing the movie listings.
"There's something on in an hour", he said without raising his head, "looks 
like something that we might both enjoy. What do you think? Is that too soon?"
"No, that sounds perfect", said Betty. The phone rang and Steve answered it.
It was Steve's brother Eric. Steve told him that they were going to the movies
and couldn't talk for long. He asked if he could tag along.
"How do you feel about Eric coming with us?", asked Steve.
"I'm OK with it, what about you?", Betty deflected it back to Steve. He wasn't
really OK with it and was hoping that Betty would make the decision for him as
he wanted to be alone with Betty. Betty on the other hand was looking for less
intimacy without making it clear that that was what she wanted. Steve sighed
before taking his hand off the mouthpiece and Betty wandered toward the bedroom.
"I'm gonna get myself ready", said Betty feeling the aspirins taking effect and
the pain receding. Steve told his brother that he could come along. He was very
alone right now and he needed the company.

A few minutes later Betty was ready and they got a cab to the cinema. They met
Eric who was already there waiting for them. He had bought the tickets and he
insisted on paying for the snacks too. Betty and Steve weren't too hungry after
their brunch but cinema demanded popcorn so they got the smallest size which was
still quite large. Eric felt guilty about imposing upon them and was doing all
he could to make it up to them. They went to see Captain Corelli's Mandolin. It
was one that they all wanted to see and the only alternative at the time was
Jay and Silent Bob. Rock Star kind of appealed to Betty but that was on later.
As they made their way to their seats Betty smiled to herself that she had 
found the perfect solution for the evening. Being close to Steve without being
close to him at all. But she had to figure out why she wanted to do that. They
could all be together without spilling their guts and just be distracted for a
while. Even though they weren't too hungry they managed to eat most of the 
popcorn over the course of the film. The film had been running since the middle
of September and it was the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday so the theatre
was fairly quiet. There was hardly a queue at the end. They sat through all the
end credits as they had no pressing engagements only a hangover to recover from.
As they came into the foyer Eric did as expected and asked them if they would
like to stop for a coffee before returning home. It was just after 5.00pm and 
Betty didn't like the idea of going home just yet and being alone with Steve.
Better to stick with Eric and listen to his problems. They went to the diner 
across the road and again Eric insisted on paying. 

Having discussed the movie briefly Eric put another sugar cube into his coffee
and stirred it slowly before speaking. Both Betty and Steve were ready for it.
"I guess you guys knew that I was in love with Anne. I mean it common 
knowledge I suppose even though I didn't really talk about it much." Eric was
made his opening statements just to see if they would be happy to talk about
it a bit more. He expressed it in words just to be doubly sure before he
proceeded.
"Do you guys mind if I talk about this?", he asked.
They nodded and shrugged at the same time giving him the affirmation that he
needed. He continued.
"I mean I'm pretty sure that she knew too. That it was more than just a liking
or whatever." He paused. Took a sip of coffee with the spoon still in the cup.
"Would have been really neat and tidy you know, older brother with older sister
and younger brother with younger sister", he chuckled to try and make light of
something that was difficult to express.
"But now we'll never know". He made a long sigh.
"Shit, sorry guys. I don't want to bore you with this shit.", he was retreating.
He needed approval and prompting.
"Hey", said Betty, "it's OK. We all miss her and we all gotta deal with it. It
may be easier if you do talk about it. We're right here and we're listening."
Betty turned to Steve for his nod and he gave it. But Steve was doing it out of
guilt and brotherly love. He just wanted to get home and snuggle up with Betty
and enjoy the rest of his Sunday in a different way before the week at work 
started again. He put those feelings away; it was still early and there was 
still time. There was hope yet. He made an inner sigh. Eric continued once more.
"Well, thanks you guys, you don't know what that means. I really appreciate it".
"Did I tell you that we went on a date?", said Eric.
