WC - 522

The day after Anne's funeral Betty and Steve are back in New York. It's a Sunday
and everything is fairly quiet apart from the continuing rescue efforts and 
people trying to make sense of their lives. For some the strategy is to try and
carry on as before; to go on living their lives, proud of who they were and to
remain undeterred. Both Betty and Steve advocated to this ethos being native
New Yorkers.

It was already around 11.00am and they were only just stirring. They hadn't had 
much of a late night but they had drank very heavily and saw some people they 
hadn't seen in a while. We tend to think that a funeral is for the dearly 
departed but they're gone, what do they know. Can they really complain about 
the music or the speeches or the amount of alcohol that was drunk? A funeral is
for the living ones to say goodbye. Betty knew that but now that it was someone
dear to her she was finding it hard to detatch herself from the whole thing as
she normally would. She needed it just as much as anyone else.

How was she to carry on without her little sister? Granted she didn't see much
of her but she knew that she was there and they did see each other on a regular
basis. Things would have to change. These were the trains of thought that ran
through Betty's brain as she was waking up that Sunday morning.

The moment she became aware of her body her cursive thoughts immediately 
drifted away. She had a headache, her eyes hurt and her stomach was getting 
ready to heave. Moving quickly but without any sudden movements she moved to
the toilet hoping not to wake Steve. She didn't like how he fussed about these
things. She closed the door to muffle the sound even further and then proceeded
to make four consecutive heaves taking a few breaths between each one. She was
waiting for a fifth one that didn't come. She rinsed her mouth and dried it 
before using the toilet in the usual fashion. As she sat there she could feel
her heart beating hard but feeling no better as she was expecting. Betty was
used to drinking and this was a regular occurrence but on this occasion she 
wasn't feeling the relief that followed a vomit. It was as if it felt worse.
In fact it did feel worse. There was also some pain around her left breast.
A glass of water from the kitchen while she walked clumsily and bleary eyed
back to the bedroom. She hadn't flushed the toilet to remain quiet. She smiled
to herself when she thought about the look on Steve's face when he would see
it. With this thought in mind she put down the glass on the nightstand and 
tucked herself back into bed. Steve hadn't moved and was snoring quietly.
She turned and took another sip of water before putting her head back on the
pillow and drifting back to sleep.
