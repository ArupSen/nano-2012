WC - 522

The day after Anne's funeral Betty and Steve are back in New York. It's a Sunday
and everything is fairly quiet apart from the continuing rescue efforts and 
people trying to make sense of their lives. For some the strategy is to try and
carry on as before; to go on living their lives, proud of who they were and to
remain undeterred. Both Betty and Steve advocated to this ethos being native
New Yorkers.

It was already around 11.00am and they were only just stirring. They hadn't had 
much of a late night but they had drank very heavily and saw some people they 
hadn't seen in a while. We tend to think that a funeral is for the dearly 
departed but they're gone, what do they know. Can they really complain about 
the music or the speeches or the amount of alcohol that was drunk? A funeral is
for the living ones to say goodbye. Betty knew that but now that it was someone
dear to her she was finding it hard to detatch herself from the whole thing as
she normally would. She needed it just as much as anyone else.

How was she to carry on without her little sister? Granted she didn't see much
of her but she knew that she was there and they did see each other on a regular
basis. Things would have to change. These were the trains of thought that ran
through Betty's brain as she was waking up that Sunday morning.

The moment she became aware of her body her cursive thoughts immediately 
drifted away. She had a headache, her eyes hurt and her stomach was getting 
ready to heave. Moving quickly but without any sudden movements she moved to
the toilet hoping not to wake Steve. She didn't like how he fussed about these
things. She closed the door to muffle the sound even further and then proceeded
to make four consecutive heaves taking a few breaths between each one. She was
waiting for a fifth one that didn't come. She rinsed her mouth and dried it 
before using the toilet in the usual fashion. As she sat there she could feel
her heart beating hard but feeling no better as she was expecting. Betty was
used to drinking and this was a regular occurrence but on this occasion she 
wasn't feeling the relief that followed a vomit. It was as if it felt worse.
In fact it did feel worse. There was also some pain around her left breast.
A glass of water from the kitchen while she walked clumsily and bleary eyed
back to the bedroom. She hadn't flushed the toilet to remain quiet. She smiled
to herself when she thought about the look on Steve's face when he would see
it. With this thought in mind she put down the glass on the nightstand and 
tucked herself back into bed. Steve hadn't moved and was snoring quietly.
She turned and took another sip of water before putting her head back on the
pillow and drifting back to sleep.

About an hour later Steve started to groan and heard some noise in the 
upstairs apartment. He was nauseous and felt a little pain in his stomach
but he wasn't on the point of vomiting like Betty. He was made of stronger
stuff or so he thought. He yawned and shrugged his shoulders hard while his
whole body trembled. With his eyes still half-closed he slid out of bed with
the familiarity of someone who completely trusts their home. He lifted the lid
of the toilet and his manly resolve almost broke. An ugly reminder of the night
before. Betty liked her practical jokes. He made an empty heave as he tried to
concentrate on aiming his stream of urine. He made sure to flush and put some 
bleach down too. The smell of the chlorine was almost like smelling salts and
had the effect of waking him somewhat. Made him think about that slogan that
went something like waking up and smelling the coffee. Which of course made
him think about coffee. He went straight to the kitchen and started to gather
together all the things required for making coffee. It was Sunday so no loss
of brownie points for getting up so late especially after a night like that
but he didn't want to miss the day altogether. He smelled the milk and it ok
but could have been fresher. Black coffee? No, he liked it with milk so it 
meant a trip downstairs. He could hear the rustle of the duvet and soon Betty
came out. 
"Morning", said Steve, "thanks for the lovely surprise".
Betty sniggered and put her hand to her mouth, still feeling a little delicate.
"I know you love surprises so I made it specially. Pretty good night uh?"
"Yeah. Good to see everyone", replied Steve slightly steering the conversation
in a more sombre direction.
Betty hadn't forgotten that it wasn't just another party and it wasn't a way of
celebrating that they were still around while her sister was gone. But those 
were the facts and she had to deal with the fact that her sister was gone. Only
one day to grieve at least officially. No official month of mourning but who
knew how long it would take till that feeling of deep shock would pass and live
would actually go on again.
Betty had been out of the kitchen window while she was thinking about these 
things and Steve had noticed it but hadn't mentioned it while he continued to
prepare the morning coffee.
"I'm going to go grab some milk from the store and maybe get the papers too. 
Don't really want to get dressed but I'd rather not go out in my pyjamas and
slippers. Won't be long. You want anything?", he asked.
"I was thinking about eggs but actually I'm not sure. Why don't you get some
anyways and maybe I'll have them later on. Actually, pastry. Yeah, pastry."
Steve got changed quickly and made a quick wave before closing the door. He 
wouldn't be long but it would be long enough for Betty to go to another world
and come back again. Her mind flashed through odd disjointed memories. Some of
them would last for a few moments while others would pass in an instant. She 
wrapped her dressing gown tighter around herself and went to sit on the sofa.
It was an open plan apartment and the kitchen was more of a kitchen area than
a room in it's own right. She wanted to look out of the front window so she
got up again and opened the curtains. The light was bright and hurt her eyes.
She could see Steve on the street below going into the store. She wondered
what else he might buy. She sat down again and crossed her legs and sat right
into the corner of the sofa. She now began to feel more than she thought. The
thoughts and images running through her mind were all still there but the 
emotions now came more fully into the foreground of her experience. A great 
wave of sadness washed over her and she could feel herself being saturated 
by it. Sort of comforting in a way as it was a feelling that one would expect
at such a time. Almost like a cold wind that chills you when you first leave
a warm house. But soon you get used to it and continue walking. You know it's
winter and that sooner or later you need to get out of the house. It's warm
inside but it's not real. The actual season and climate were out of doors
and you had to face it. If you were wearing the right clothes then it was fine.
Betty was wearing the right clothes and she could bear the cold wind of her
sadness. It was that particular season and until that winter ended and spring
arrived, she would feel that chill right through into her bones. She would go
inside to sleep and be with her man but only for part of the time. And as one
gets accustomed to the cold one sees the finer details like the patterns on 
the snowflake: a touch of regret, a hint of anger, confusion, jealousy but most
of all a question which asked her what now? Her sister was dead: what did that
mean? She was going to die too and all of her friends and her family. Yes, all
of them. Every one. There was nothing that she could do about it except to 
accept that it was going to happen. She only just seemed to notice that tears
had been running down her face while she was examining her feelings and letting
them wash over her. She wiped her eyes on her sleeve when she heard the key go
into the door and the sound of Steve returning.
