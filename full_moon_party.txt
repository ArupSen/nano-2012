The trio attend a traditional Goan full moon party with trance and techo music,
drugs galore and a multitude of hippies. Betty takes something that she thinks is
extacy and gets very cocksure and horny. WC - 3712

On most days around sunset the bar at the top of the hill would start to pump out
techo music to signify the start of the evening. It was called Joe Banana but had
recently changed management and was now called the Paradise Bar. It attrated old
and young alike mainly looking like travellers and hippies but they didn't all 
have that background but looked as though they did. When in Rome as they say. The
sound isn't especially loud and usually sounds very distant and muffled but 
tonight it was very loud even from the beach which meant that it must be quite
deafening at the bar itself. Betty looked up toward the Paradise Bar from her
deck chair and looked at the others. 
"What's happening?", she asked.
"Full moon tonight. There'll be a few full moon parties." said Rufus.
"Do they have to put it so loud? Those guys must be going deaf." said Betty.
"They want to attract attention. They can make a lot of money on a full moon 
night, so that's why it's loud. People meet at the bars to get the locations of
the secret parties", said Alex.
"Why are they secret?", asked Betty.
"Because of the drugs mainly. Goa is very anti-drugs or at least is seen to be.
As soon as the police hear about any event like this they'll be there in a shot.
They'll take bakshish but they'll also break up the party as well. Sometimes 
there are decoy parties as well, where they'll have a smaller party and they
will publicise that one more than the main one and if it does get busted then
the police generally don't look for another one", said Alex again.
"You been to a full moon party?", asked Rufus looking at Betty.
"No, I haven't".
"Oh man, we have to go then".
"It's not really worth it. I mean it's just like any other trippy techno beach
party isn't it", said Alex.
"Come on man, it's a real spectacle. Betty should give it a look. Maybe even 
take something", said Rufus.
"What do you mean take something?", asked Betty.
"He means drugs", said Alex.
"Yeah, like drop an e or a trip. Bit o' whizz maybe. Good mushrooms here too",
said Rufus as though he was reading from a restaurant menu.
"I'm not sure Betty's into all that, are you Betty?", asked Alex as he looked
at Betty.
"Nope, never tried any of those things. Coffee and alcohol is as far as I've 
been. But who knows, there's a first time for everything." Betty shrugged but
didn't dismiss the idea out of hand.
"Oh right", chuckled Rufus,"Might be a bit full on then."
"What do you mean, full on?" asked Betty. Sometimes there were language 
problems between English UK and English US. 
"What he means is that the experience of taking any of the drugs that he mentioned
could and probably would be quite overwhelming especially as you've never had
that experience before. It would a completely new experience and you would be
a big crowd of people in the dark with the possibility of a police prescence.
Sometimes they like to make examples of foreign tourists even though their 
economy depends on it. They want to show that any undesirable elements are not
home grown. But the main thing for you is that taking any form of drug is a 
journey into the unknown and in my opinion it's better to do it for the first
time in a much safer environment. You know, maybe just the three of us in a
room or a quiet beach or something, so if anything did go wrong, I mean not
that it would but you know if it did, then we could help out more easily."
explained Alex.
"What could go wrong? I mean how is it different from getting seriously drunk?
Sometimes you throw up or do some silly things but I can't see anything worse
than that," said Betty looking confused.
"Oh man, you're being all heavy man. It's not that big a deal. You do an e and
you get a bit loved up. Or you do a trip and see everything go a bit wobbly or
snort some whizz and run around. I mean it's just a bit of a laarf innit?"
said Rufus putting his point of view.
"Well, that's what I was thinking", said Betty,"if you take a safe amount then
it's like getting drunk or something. Am I wrong?"
Alex didn't want to come out and say that she was naive or that he was over
playing the dangers. But the dangers were very real and he needed to get that
message across without making her angry or feel stupid. If anything that would
make her want to do it even more to prove a point. And proving a point was her
job.
"OK, put it this way, can you think back to when you first had a drink. Say in
your teens or whenever it was. And Rufus, can you think back to when you had 
your first Extacy experience or LSD? I mean not just what you did and how you
made a fool of yourself but how it was that first time. You know the change 
from being straight or sober to being off your tits."
Rufus answered first.
"It was intense man. I mean not just the first time but the first few times
as it goes. Yeah, man. It was so different to anything that I'd experienced 
before. Very different from being sober. Very different. I see what you're 
getting at Alex. I mean I don't feel that any more. I kind of know what's going
to happen so it's not much of a shock or surprise. I still get loved up when 
take e's but it's not like it was those first few times. I mean even I take a
couple of tabs I can get close but not like that. Maybe they're cut or what-
ever."
"And where were you when you had those first experiences?", asked Alex.
"I was at my mate's house in Deptford. Yeah. There were four of us I think and
we started sort of mid-afternoon and then early hours the next day we were 
still quite high and only just starting to come down. But yeah, as you were
sayin before it was quite safe. I mean it wasn't a party just some mates 
together smoking weed and that and we tried some e. But yeah, it was quite an
intense experience. Maybe I wouldn't have done it at a club or at a party."
Rufus was looking a bit pensive and now swayed by Alex's position and was
thinking more about erring on the side of caution.
Alex looked at Betty and she recounted her tale of her first alcoholic
experience. 
"I was at a friend's house and I was in my early teens I guess. Their parents
were out and we were just watching TV and looking through magazines. Then the
girl who lived there asked if we'd like to try a drink. She said that she was
allowed one when they had their Sunday dinner or they had guests but only one.
There were only three of us, the girl who lived there myself and other friend.
We went downstairs to the sitting room and there was a table with lots of 
drinks on it. There were bottles of whisky and brandy and decanters and the 
kind of thing you see where people like a drink. My parents didn't have any-
thing like that. They drank but they usually bought something for the occassion
but didn't really keep stocks. I mean they do now but didn't then. So I hadn't
even seen anything like this before. Lea, the girl whose house it was made us
a cocktail each. She said it would be easier to drink if it was mixed and if
we couldn't taste the alcohol. She got some Coke and put some clear liquid in
it which I guess was Rum and put some ice in there. She said it was what her
mother would drink if they had guests. She handed us our drinks and said cheers
and bottoms up. Then she took a big sip. We looked at each other and took very
small sips. It was Coke but there was this strange taste that went along with
it."
Betty looked away for a moment and noticed the first star of that evening. She
wondered where the moon had gone. Wasn't it full moon, didn't that mean it would
be bright? She continued.
"I remember after I swallowed that there was a burning sensation. I mean it 
wasn't a strong sensation but tangible. I took another sip and I kinda liked it.
The other girl took a sip too. I guess there was enough Coke in there to mask
out the rum. Lea took a big sip as she was used to it or so she led us to 
believe. It didn't take us long to finish our first glass and we could feel the
effects more or less immediately. It was as Rufus was saying, quite intense. I 
had never felt anything like that before. I felt light and dizzy and giggly and
kind of strong as well. We took it easy and didn't take it too far. I think we
each had another one and that was all but it was enough to give us the effect.
I think we all liked it. We all giggled and played and ran around teasing each
other. But there was no harm done at all. There was no violence of any kind and
when the parents came home and saw us they just smiled. Nothing was broken and
we generally all had a pretty good time. The next few times were pretty much 
the same. But sure, I don't get that now when I drink, I know what to expect."
There was a short pause where no-one spoke and digested what had been said. 
Then Alex spoke.
"My first times were pretty similar. Fairly safe environments. Doing it with
friends, people that you trusted. And you both took sensible doses just to try
it out. No pressure to take it any further. You know. But there is another
danger that we haven't mentioned which is that the drug itself may not be pure.
I mean I've taken LSD which was contaminated with Strichnine and Extacy that was
mixed with speed. Even Cannabis that was mixed with Heroin. I mean 99 times out
of a hundred when you buy something that's what you get. But these dealers are
out to make money and if they can dilute it to increase their profit margins
they will. So there's that to consider", said Alex being cautious again. "I
mean that would be another reason to experiment in a safer environment than a
party or big gathering like this so that if you did pass out or whatever then
you'd be at home."
"I think you'll be alright. I mean I've taken stuff here and it's been fine
you know. But yeah, first time might be a bit intense, so I don't know." 
"I don't know either, but who knows when I'll have a chance like this again. 
It's an event like a New Year's party or something where people let their hair
down and party hard. And I mean I trust you guys: you'll take care of me if
anything happens so why not. Can you run those choices by me again?"
"You don't have to try these things. I mean just because everyone else seems
to be doing it. People eat deep fried cockroaches in China, would you try them
if you were there on holiday?", said Alex, still trying to dissuade her.
"Alex, I appeciate your warnings and I know I don't have to but I'm kind of in
a limbo at the moment and I could handle trying something new you know. I think
it would be fun. I'm a grown woman and I'll take my chances."
"Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Any of these drugs are pretty mindblowing
and much more so than alcohol. Add to that the possibility of contamination, 
loads of people off their heads and maybe the police turning up and you have a
 recipe for a nightmare", Alex was continuing to make his point.
"I don't know if I even want to go. Last time I went the music was shit and I 
just left after a little bit. But then I have been to some that have been 
really good. So I don't want to write it off altogether."
"Man, you're such a party pooper. Be positive why don't you. We'll go, get off
our nuts and have a nice time. And then we'll have another nice day on the 
beach. I mean that's it right. Easy." Rufus stated his case.
Betty listened to both arguments and gave judgement.
"OK, it's starting to get dark and chilly and we're getting into the evening. 
So we need to make a decision. I think I'd like to go and check it out either
sober or off my nuts but I don't want to go on my own. So it would be cool if
both of you would come. I mean if the music isn't good then we can all leave.
But I really would like to try something and with you two there with me I 
think I would feel safe enough. How about we go and get some dinner and then
head over to the bar to find where the party is at?" 
"We don't need to go there 'cos I know where it's at already", said Rufus
with a smug grin."One of them market geezers told me about it and I think he's
doing the music too. So I think it's all good."
"Oh, all right then", said Alex, "why not. I've never seen you off your face."
Betty gave Alex a peck on the cheek. 
"Cool. I'll go and get changed. See you both at the Mango Tree in 10 minutes?"
"Sounds good", said Rufus. Alex nodded.

It was actually a fairly warm evening with the occasional breeze. Alex was
suggesting that they didn't eat too much in case they felt sick. It did happen
sometimes. Rufus thought he was being over cautious of course. That was true. 
He was only doing it for Betty's sake. She appreciated the hand holding. They
all had a simple veg curry and rice along with a beer and some samosas on the
side. The party venue wasn't a huge distance away and really didn't require any
form of transport. It was a warm evening and the light of the moon made it seem
like day. They decided to walk. The streets weren't lit and even with the moon
it was hard to see holes in the road. There were often people coming the other
way along with cows, pigs and dogs. Sometimes they would see other ravers with
glowing necklaces or wristbands. Sometimes even a torch but that was rare. With
no tree canopy in places the road was bathed in moonlight. When one of them
stopped to admire the view the others did too. They were climbing up to a high
spot away from the beach and as well as the road itself they got a haunting 
view of the beach from up on high. The path was getting a bit gravelly and it
was a good thing that Betty had opted for her walking boots along with her hot
pants. She was starting to look more like a hippy each day. A t-shirt with a
plunging neck line and jaggedly cut at the sleeves, a bead necklace and even
her hair had a few thin plaits and some experimental dreads. Only one bangle
so far. The others thought about making a comment but resisted. She would see
it for herself soon enough.

Just as Betty started to wonder if they should have taken transport after all
they arrived at their destination. 
"Here we are folks", said Rufus,"doesn't look like much does it". They looked
around and saw more and more people arriving. The area was just a bit of 
clearing at the top of the hill. It looked a bit like a car park you might find
when venturing to the top of a monument. There were one or two vans and cars
dotted around. But the main form of motorised transport was scooters and motor-
cycles. Girls in their early twenties with large plasters and bandages on the
inside of their legs just below the knees: a telltale sign of their riding on
motorcycles. These were burns they had received from the hot engine against
bare skin. The fact that most people had these plasters made them feel a bit
less conspicuous but nonetheless it was a blow to their sense of fashion. Even
though they were hippies they still wanted to look good and look better than 
the next hippy and make it look effortless. Vogue had a way of penetrating all
walks of life. There were a few stalls too selling snacks, drinks and the usual
trinkets. There was always some money to be made. The stalls had light but other
than that there was only the light of the moon. At the far edge of this clearing
was a cliff and the party sound system was situated there. The decks were inside
what looked like another stall and either side on bamboo stands stood too very
large PA speakers. They looked fairly weather beaten but up to the job. The DJ
had the usual kit, a set of record decks, a mixer, headphones, microphone and
a box of records. They were in the process of doing tests and soundchecks. You
would hear a sudden loud phrase from a record followed by clipping and then a
hum. The dealers were already in force and could be seen moving from one group
to the next having a short conversation and moving on. Things were just getting
started.
"Kind of fancy a bit of mushroom punch tonight rather than e or trips. You know
keep things natural and that", Rufus said feeling in a holistic mood.
"Oh would that help you to connect with the atmosphere do you think?", asked
Betty half ironically.
Rufus got the joke but didn't respond.
"Nah, just fancy it that's all. Dunno, just in that kind of mood".
"You still want to do something Betty?", asked Alex.
"Yeah. I feel kind of quietly confident, you know, like I know it's going to be
a good night and I'm going to have a good time." Betty was trying to tone down
how keen she was and Alex was trying to hide how much he was concerned. He 
couldn't play the parent any longer and that being with them was as safe as it 
got for her. 
"Shall we get a drink or something?", asked Rufus, "pass the time while they're
setting up and that."
They walked over to one of the stalls and got three bottles of Thums Up. Sickly
sweet but it was cold. Just the thing on warmish night. They took a sip and 
could hear the sound of motorcycles nearby and in the distance. More people were
arriving. They wandered over to the DJ to see how things were progressing. They
didn't want to impose themselves but wanted to say hi and get an idea of the 
music for the evening. They gathered that the music was due to start in half an
hour or so and that there were three sets planned that evening each one lasting
about 2 hours. The DJ looked a bit nervous and complained about the equipment.
They walked just behind the DJ's stall and looked down over the cliff. It was a
sheer drop and probably not the best place to hold a party with intoxicated 
revellers running around. But that's how it was in Goa; everything was very much
at your own risk.

Rufus threw his empty bottle down the cliff. It hit the side and smashed into 
pieces. He pressed his lips together and raised his eyebrows and nodded. The 
others merely tutted. They moved away from the cliff edge and turned to find 
that numbers had grown significantly and that the previously empty car park was
starting to look more like a concert venue. There were some more colourful 
people amongst the gathering and also more light. There were some strung lights
near the edges of the car park rather like christmas tree light hung between
trees. But rather than tiny lights they had big light bulbs. It was starting to
look like christmas street decorations. Once the lights had been switched on 
there was a great cheer and the music started. Atmospheric trippy techno with
some familiar tunes elicited some whoops from the crowd. The DJ was from the
UK and made some general announcements and welcomes over the microphone. He 
reminded everyone that this was an illegal party as they didn't have an official
license and that meant it could be stopped by the police at any time. He told 
them that there would be three sets and very soon turned off the mic. The warm
up tunes continued but only a handful were dancing so far. Most were still 
milling around either looking for drugs or waiting for whatever drug they had
taken to take effect. Betty could sense this tension. It was like five to 
midnight on New Year's Eve. It was now or never. If she was going to be part 
of the crowd then she had to first decide that she did indeed want to try a
hard substance and secondly which one. She also had to decide soon. She opted
for extacy.

It didn't take long for our man Rufus to procure said substance in the form of
tablets. Alex looked at Betty once more and with a look that asked if she was
still sure about what she was about to do. Betty returned the look by poking out
her tongue at him and blowing a raspberry that was silent amongst the background
noise of the party. Alex leaned in and told her only to consume half a tablet 
rather than a whole one as it was her first time. But Rufus vetoed this warning
with his own reasoning that as it indeed was her first time she should embrace
that element by taking a full dose and experiencing the full force of it as the
first time could only be experienced once and only once. Alex had no counter to
that argument except to shrug his shoulders. Betty grinned as she reached for 
Rufus's open palm and take a small tablet between her thumb and forefinger. It
was about the size of an aspirin and almost the same shape with a relief of a
dove pressed into it. 
"These are quite pure as it goes," said Rufus, "not cut with speed or anything, 
so you'll be loved up but without all the running about."
Rufus was knowledgable on every drug that was in circulation and was also 
experienced in their usage. Unlike a GP he not only prescribed them but didn't 
require a textbook to have a knowledge of their effects, he had first hand
experience. Having listened to the label Betty unscrewed the lid from the top of
her water bottle and swallowed her pill. She then took a few more gulps of water.
"Usually about half an hour," said Rufus,"shall we try and find a nice spot in
case you need to sit down or whatever."
The plane was on the runway and the fasten seatbelt sign was on. There was no
turning back now. Rufus put his hand on her back and ushered her gently toward 
a clear area near one of the stalls. There were some hurricane lamps burning and
there was a small queue of people waiting for their omelettes and some other 
people sitting on the ground listening to the sound. Rufus nodded to the people
that were closest and pointed at the clear ground. They shook their heads to 
indicate that the area wasn't occupied. They all sat down on the small blanket
that Rufus had brought with him. The ground wasn't comfortable but at least they
had somewhere to sit and a sort of base camp to return to. Betty smiled knowing
that she ought not to take the experience too lightly. Even Rufus was now taking
precautions and he was the reckless one. Alex hadn't spoken in all this time but
now he too opened up his bottle of water and took a swig. She didn't see if he
took anything.
"Did you just take one too?", asked Betty.
"Yeah, exactly the same one. Rufus just had one as well. So we can be there with
you."
She saw Rufus wipe excess water from his lips. They were all on the same flight.
It was ready for takeoff and it was taxiing to the end of the runway. This time
she just said what she thought.
"Oh god, there's no going back now is there?"
Alex and Rufus both shook their heads.
"I've had these ones before," said Rufus, "they're pretty good and very smooth.
Quite rushy though when they come."
"OK."
More people were still arriving and there was a beautiful night sky revealing a
moon that looked much bigger and brighter than usual. As though it was closer 
to the earth. It wasn't crowded but enough to need to push past people if you 
needed to go anywhere. Such as the stall selling bottles of water which was at
the other side of the dance area. The volume of the sound system had gone up a
few decibels and Betty was both thirsty and in need of a toilet. Toilet first 
she though followed by water. But she didn't remember any toilets and she didn't
want to be parted from her friends when the drug would first take effect. She 
was sure that they would have gone with her but then they would have lost their
spot and she was already attached to it. She asked Alex if he had seen a toilet
anywhere but he shook his head and pointed toward some of the big rocks. He 
pulled a small torch from his pocket and gave it to her. She nodded and accepted.
With the brightness of the moon it was probably not even necessary but it was 
still very dark in the shadows. She only wanted to get far enough so she was out
of view but also close enough so she could rush back. She found a quite spot 
behind a large rock and found another girl doing the same. The girl stiffened a
little when she saw the torch light but then relaxed again when she noticed that
it was another woman. Betty turned off the torch and did her business. It was 
then she realised that she had no paper. One had to be self-sufficient in these
situations. Luckily the other girl had a small pack of tissues and handed her 
one. In a more conventional Western context they might have chatted before they
left their makeshift toilet but out here on a cliff in the darkness it didn't 
seem so appropriate. Betty hopped and skipped back to the blanket and to her 
relief saw that there were more bottles of water. She sat down to feel a slight
tremble. She wasn't sure if it was the depth of the bass sound or if she was 
feeling cold and shivering slightly. She could feel the hairs on the back of her
neck standing on end and then lower down her back. Then over her shoulders and
along her arms. Soon her cheeks were involved along with the rest of her face.
She looked across to the others and wondered if they were feeling the same and
if the drug was starting to take effect. Her question was answered momentarily
when those sensations of tingling and goose bumps began to spread all over her
body and doubling and trebling in intensity. Her whole body began to tremble
as though she had a fever and at the same time had just jumped into a very cold
water. But that was only her body. Her breathing grew deep and rhythmic. She 
began to breathe through the mouth just as if she were walking out of the cold
sea. Inside she felt the same kind of exhilaration that she felt at the end of
a run or after a swim but again magnified twice or three times. This was the 
rush they had spoken of. She reached out and took a man in each hand. Rufus with
her left and Alex with her right. She clasped their hands tightly and motioned
them to move closer. They understood what was going on as soon as they saw her
face and the breathing. Being veterans the two men didn't feel the rush as 
strongly as Betty but felt it all the same. They both looked at her as they each
felt their own rush and imagined their own first time. That feeling of newness
and that it was more intense than they had ever imagined. The feeling seemed to
intensify until all other aspects of her experience such as what she saw in 
front of her face, the sound of the music, the clasp of the hands all faded into
the background and the rushing sensation was stronger than anything else. As 
well as the physical aspect of the rush the feeling of euphoria and well being 
also grew to a great crescendo. Her breathing got stronger and deeper and she
felt as though both her physical and emotional heart would burst apart. The 
whole thing was rapturous and beyond anything she had ever experienced. It was
like all of her favourite moments were happening at the same time. Like the 
strongest and most prolonged orgasms she had ever had but magnified. The 
intensity climbed yet higher and she wondered how much higher it could possibly
go. She felt a glimmer of panic and looked at her friends. They beamed at her 
with big grins across their faces which settled her worries immediately and soon
she hit the peak of this so called rush. Slowly the both the physical and the 
emotional experience calmed to a level that was still very tangible and well 
above her normal everyday level of physical and emotional euphoria. She came 
back to her senses but with this added good feeling. She liked it to be being a
bit tipsy but with more of a clarity of mind than with alcohol.
"Told you you needed to have a whole one. You would have regretted it if you had
had only a half", said Rufus reassuringly. "What a rush eh. So nice."
Betty had stopped rushing but couldn't yet articulate any words. She leaned 
across and put her arms around his neck and hugged him. He stroked her back in
return and the back of her head. She pulled away and beamed at him breathing 
hard. He chuckled and nodded. Alex was smiling quietly and looking across. More
of a smirk than a smile. She turned and saw him then leaned over put her head
into his lap and put her arm around his waist. He patted her on the back and 
looked over at Rufus on his left and blew out some air. Betty soon got up as 
even though some extra contact was allowed under the influence there was still
a time limit after which things would feel awkward. The fact that Betty was 
aware of this in her current state showed both her friends and her that she was
not overwhelmed by the substance. She reached for a bottle of water and took off
the cap and took a long drink. The sensation of the water travelling down her 
oesophagus was akin to being massaged on the inside. She felt an urge to talk
about it but held back and simply enjoyed it.

It wasn't just Betty and her friends that were starting to feel the effects of
their ingested substances. Many of the other participants were feeling the same
way. One of the stalls was selling mushroom wine as they called it. It was a 
local hallucinogenic mushroom that had been steeped in honey for a year or so.
This was a traditional full moon party drink and for some of the revellers that
evening the drug of choice. Since they had sat down and noticed the numbers 
build steadily they hadn't noticed that there were many actually dancing but 
that had now changed. The DJ was well beyond his warm up tracks and very much 
into his set. The flourescent wrist bands could be seen moving rhythmically as
well as the tie dyed t-shirts glowing under the ultra violet lamps. People bared
their eyes and teeth to each other as anything white had the same demonic glow
which was decidedly trippy. Betty, Rufus and Alex all got up to join them in 
their gyrations. There seemed to be certain staccato movements that were favoured
by the crowd but there was no pressure to follow the trend. The ethos of these
parties and this music was that it was breaking with tradition and people could
experiment with a new way of relating to it. They weren't obliged to dance in
the way they might dance to other Western forms of music. But just like any new
trend it could easily start its own tradition and norms and conventions and soon
another new movement would be required to break away from that one.
