The trio attend a traditional Goan full moon party with trance and techo music,
drugs galore and a multitude of hippies. Betty takes something that she thinks is
extacy and gets very cocksure and horny. WC - 2421

On most days around sunset the bar at the top of the hill would start to pump out
techo music to signify the start of the evening. It was called Joe Banana but had
recently changed management and was now called the Paradise Bar. It attrated old
and young alike mainly looking like travellers and hippies but they didn't all 
have that background but looked as though they did. When in Rome as they say. The
sound isn't especially loud and usually sounds very distant and muffled but 
tonight it was very loud even from the beach which meant that it must be quite
deafening at the bar itself. Betty looked up toward the Paradise Bar from her
deck chair and looked at the others. 
"What's happening?", she asked.
"Full moon tonight. There'll be a few full moon parties." said Rufus.
"Do they have to put it so loud? Those guys must be going deaf." said Betty.
"They want to attract attention. They can make a lot of money on a full moon 
night, so that's why it's loud. People meet at the bars to get the locations of
the secret parties", said Alex.
"Why are they secret?", asked Betty.
"Because of the drugs mainly. Goa is very anti-drugs or at least is seen to be.
As soon as the police hear about any event like this they'll be there in a shot.
They'll take bakshish but they'll also break up the party as well. Sometimes 
there are decoy parties as well, where they'll have a smaller party and they
will publicise that one more than the main one and if it does get busted then
the police generally don't look for another one", said Alex again.
"You been to a full moon party?", asked Rufus looking at Betty.
"No, I haven't".
"Oh man, we have to go then".
"It's not really worth it. I mean it's just like any other trippy techno beach
party isn't it", said Alex.
"Come on man, it's a real spectacle. Betty should give it a look. Maybe even 
take something", said Rufus.
"What do you mean take something?", asked Betty.
"He means drugs", said Alex.
"Yeah, like drop an e or a trip. Bit o' whizz maybe. Good mushrooms here too",
said Rufus as though he was reading from a restaurant menu.
"I'm not sure Betty's into all that, are you Betty?", asked Alex as he looked
at Betty.
"Nope, never tried any of those things. Coffee and alcohol is as far as I've 
been. But who knows, there's a first time for everything." Betty shrugged but
didn't dismiss the idea out of hand.
"Oh right", chuckled Rufus,"Might be a bit full on then."
"What do you mean, full on?" asked Betty. Sometimes there were language 
problems between English UK and English US. 
"What he means is that the experience of taking any of the drugs that he mentioned
could and probably would be quite overwhelming especially as you've never had
that experience before. It would a completely new experience and you would be
a big crowd of people in the dark with the possibility of a police prescence.
Sometimes they like to make examples of foreign tourists even though their 
economy depends on it. They want to show that any undesirable elements are not
home grown. But the main thing for you is that taking any form of drug is a 
journey into the unknown and in my opinion it's better to do it for the first
time in a much safer environment. You know, maybe just the three of us in a
room or a quiet beach or something, so if anything did go wrong, I mean not
that it would but you know if it did, then we could help out more easily."
explained Alex.
"What could go wrong? I mean how is it different from getting seriously drunk?
Sometimes you throw up or do some silly things but I can't see anything worse
than that," said Betty looking confused.
"Oh man, you're being all heavy man. It's not that big a deal. You do an e and
you get a bit loved up. Or you do a trip and see everything go a bit wobbly or
snort some whizz and run around. I mean it's just a bit of a laarf innit?"
said Rufus putting his point of view.
"Well, that's what I was thinking", said Betty,"if you take a safe amount then
it's like getting drunk or something. Am I wrong?"
Alex didn't want to come out and say that she was naive or that he was over
playing the dangers. But the dangers were very real and he needed to get that
message across without making her angry or feel stupid. If anything that would
make her want to do it even more to prove a point. And proving a point was her
job.
"OK, put it this way, can you think back to when you first had a drink. Say in
your teens or whenever it was. And Rufus, can you think back to when you had 
your first Extacy experience or LSD? I mean not just what you did and how you
made a fool of yourself but how it was that first time. You know the change 
from being straight or sober to being off your tits."
Rufus answered first.
"It was intense man. I mean not just the first time but the first few times
as it goes. Yeah, man. It was so different to anything that I'd experienced 
before. Very different from being sober. Very different. I see what you're 
getting at Alex. I mean I don't feel that any more. I kind of know what's going
to happen so it's not much of a shock or surprise. I still get loved up when 
take e's but it's not like it was those first few times. I mean even I take a
couple of tabs I can get close but not like that. Maybe they're cut or what-
ever."
"And where were you when you had those first experiences?", asked Alex.
"I was at my mate's house in Deptford. Yeah. There were four of us I think and
we started sort of mid-afternoon and then early hours the next day we were 
still quite high and only just starting to come down. But yeah, as you were
sayin before it was quite safe. I mean it wasn't a party just some mates 
together smoking weed and that and we tried some e. But yeah, it was quite an
intense experience. Maybe I wouldn't have done it at a club or at a party."
Rufus was looking a bit pensive and now swayed by Alex's position and was
thinking more about erring on the side of caution.
Alex looked at Betty and she recounted her tale of her first alcoholic
experience. 
"I was at a friend's house and I was in my early teens I guess. Their parents
were out and we were just watching TV and looking through magazines. Then the
girl who lived there asked if we'd like to try a drink. She said that she was
allowed one when they had their Sunday dinner or they had guests but only one.
There were only three of us, the girl who lived there myself and other friend.
We went downstairs to the sitting room and there was a table with lots of 
drinks on it. There were bottles of whisky and brandy and decanters and the 
kind of thing you see where people like a drink. My parents didn't have any-
thing like that. They drank but they usually bought something for the occassion
but didn't really keep stocks. I mean they do now but didn't then. So I hadn't
even seen anything like this before. Lea, the girl whose house it was made us
a cocktail each. She said it would be easier to drink if it was mixed and if
we couldn't taste the alcohol. She got some Coke and put some clear liquid in
it which I guess was Rum and put some ice in there. She said it was what her
mother would drink if they had guests. She handed us our drinks and said cheers
and bottoms up. Then she took a big sip. We looked at each other and took very
small sips. It was Coke but there was this strange taste that went along with
it."
Betty looked away for a moment and noticed the first star of that evening. She
wondered where the moon had gone. Wasn't it full moon, didn't that mean it would
be bright? She continued.
"I remember after I swallowed that there was a burning sensation. I mean it 
wasn't a strong sensation but tangible. I took another sip and I kinda liked it.
The other girl took a sip too. I guess there was enough Coke in there to mask
out the rum. Lea took a big sip as she was used to it or so she led us to 
believe. It didn't take us long to finish our first glass and we could feel the
effects more or less immediately. It was as Rufus was saying, quite intense. I 
had never felt anything like that before. I felt light and dizzy and giggly and
kind of strong as well. We took it easy and didn't take it too far. I think we
each had another one and that was all but it was enough to give us the effect.
I think we all liked it. We all giggled and played and ran around teasing each
other. But there was no harm done at all. There was no violence of any kind and
when the parents came home and saw us they just smiled. Nothing was broken and
we generally all had a pretty good time. The next few times were pretty much 
the same. But sure, I don't get that now when I drink, I know what to expect."
There was a short pause where no-one spoke and digested what had been said. 
Then Alex spoke.
"My first times were pretty similar. Fairly safe environments. Doing it with
friends, people that you trusted. And you both took sensible doses just to try
it out. No pressure to take it any further. You know. But there is another
danger that we haven't mentioned which is that the drug itself may not be pure.
I mean I've taken LSD which was contaminated with Strichnine and Extacy that was
mixed with speed. Even Cannabis that was mixed with Heroin. I mean 99 times out
of a hundred when you buy something that's what you get. But these dealers are
out to make money and if they can dilute it to increase their profit margins
they will. So there's that to consider", said Alex being cautious again. "I
mean that would be another reason to experiment in a safer environment than a
party or big gathering like this so that if you did pass out or whatever then
you'd be at home."
"I think you'll be alright. I mean I've taken stuff here and it's been fine
you know. But yeah, first time might be a bit intense, so I don't know." 
"I don't know either, but who knows when I'll have a chance like this again. 
It's an event like a New Year's party or something where people let their hair
down and party hard. And I mean I trust you guys: you'll take care of me if
anything happens so why not. Can you run those choices by me again?"
"You don't have to try these things. I mean just because everyone else seems
to be doing it. People eat deep fried cockroaches in China, would you try them
if you were there on holiday?", said Alex, still trying to dissuade her.
"Alex, I appeciate your warnings and I know I don't have to but I'm kind of in
a limbo at the moment and I could handle trying something new you know. I think
it would be fun. I'm a grown woman and I'll take my chances."
"Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Any of these drugs are pretty mindblowing
and much more so than alcohol. Add to that the possibility of contamination, 
loads of people off their heads and maybe the police turning up and you have a
 recipe for a nightmare", Alex was continuing to make his point.
"I don't know if I even want to go. Last time I went the music was shit and I 
just left after a little bit. But then I have been to some that have been 
really good. So I don't want to write it off altogether."
"Man, you're such a party pooper. Be positive why don't you. We'll go, get off
our nuts and have a nice time. And then we'll have another nice day on the 
beach. I mean that's it right. Easy." Rufus stated his case.
Betty listened to both arguments and gave judgement.
"OK, it's starting to get dark and chilly and we're getting into the evening. 
So we need to make a decision. I think I'd like to go and check it out either
sober or off my nuts but I don't want to go on my own. So it would be cool if
both of you would come. I mean if the music isn't good then we can all leave.
But I really would like to try something and with you two there with me I 
think I would feel safe enough. How about we go and get some dinner and then
head over to the bar to find where the party is at?" 
"We don't need to go there 'cos I know where it's at already", said Rufus
with a smug grin."One of them market geezers told me about it and I think he's
doing the music too. So I think it's all good."
"Oh, all right then", said Alex, "why not. I've never seen you off your face."
Betty gave Alex a peck on the cheek. 
"Cool. I'll go and get changed. See you both at the Mango Tree in 10 minutes?"
"Sounds good", said Rufus. Alex nodded.

It was actually a fairly warm evening with the occasional breeze. Alex was
suggesting that they didn't eat too much in case they felt sick. It did happen
sometimes. Rufus thought he was being over cautious of course. That was true. 
He was only doing it for Betty's sake. She appreciated the hand holding. They
all had a simple veg curry and rice along with a beer and some samosas on the
side. The party venue wasn't a huge distance away and really didn't require any
form of transport. It was a warm evening and the light of the moon made it seem
like day. They decided to walk. The streets weren't lit and even with the moon
it was hard to see holes in the road. There were often people coming the other
way along with cows, pigs and dogs. Sometimes they would see other ravers with
glowing necklaces or wristbands. Sometimes even a torch but that was rare. With
no tree canopy in places the road was bathed in moonlight. When one of them
stopped to admire the view the others did too. They were climbing up to a high
spot away from the beach and as well as the road itself they got a haunting 
view of the beach from up on high. The path was getting a bit gravelly and it
was a good thing that Betty had opted for her walking boots along with her hot
pants. She was starting to look more like a hippy each day. A t-shirt with a
plunging neck line and jaggedly cut at the sleeves, a bead necklace and even
her hair had a few thin plaits and some experimental dreads. Only one bangle
so far. The others thought about making a comment but resisted. She would see
it for herself soon enough.
