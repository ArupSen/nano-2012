Notes and ideas for my NaNoWriMo 2012 novel. This is my first time doing NaNo

// Swimming in the sea at sunset
// Party on (Goa) beach with a bonfire
// Following the sunset around the world
// Philosophical conversations
// Compelled to do stuff based on these conversations
// Betty has breast cancer or other cancer
// Betty used to have a corporate career and was very business minded but is now
becoming less skeptical about so called 'hippy shit' after her diagnosis
// This is a pilgrimage to find herself
// The novel is narrated in the first person by one of her travelling companions
// Betty Klein is not her real name. She did this to hide her true identity
so that she could stay under the radar from her corporate colleagues. Her real 
name is on her passport.
// Full moon party
// tells husband about her cancer on her honeymoon in Goa
// she doesn't want treatment and her husband can't deal with it
// Trudy's husband died after an attack with an intruder, after which Trudy 
took up self-defense classes and Taekwondo
// One travelling companion is called Rufus
// Narrator is called Alex who is a hippy with dreads and a van
