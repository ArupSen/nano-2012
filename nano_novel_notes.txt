Notes and ideas for my NaNoWriMo 2012 novel. This is my first time doing NaNo

// Swimming in the sea at sunset
// Party on (Goa) beach with a bonfire
// Following the sunset around the world
// Philosophical conversations
// Compelled to do stuff based on these conversations
// Betty has breast cancer or other cancer
// Betty used to have a corporate career and was very business minded but is now
becoming less skeptical about so called 'hippy shit' after her diagnosis
// This is a pilgrimage to find herself
// Betty Klein is not her real name. She did this to hide her true identity
so that she could stay under the radar from her corporate colleagues. Her real 
name is on her passport.
// Full moon party
// tells husband about her cancer on her honeymoon in Goa
// she doesn't want treatment and her husband can't deal with it
// Trudy's husband died after an attack with an intruder, after which Trudy 
took up self-defense classes and Taekwondo
// One travelling companion is called Rufus
// Narrator is called Alex who is a hippy with dreads and a van
// Betty likes to have her breasts out whenever possible to give the finger
to her cancer.
// Betty wears her wedding ring because she is married and to keep men away.
As Alex is around her most of the time people think he's the husband even 
though he has no ring.
// After 911 there isn't much there is a lot of security around flying so for
them to fly to Goa is a big deal
// The full moon party is toward the end of the novel when she finally reveals
that she has breast cancer. It is after this that goes about with her tits oot.
// The story ends with death. Betty has cancer and she has to die but how? Will
the cancer kill her or something else? One scenario is that she is off her tits
on extacy and swims out to the sun. Rufus follows her but also disappers. The 
next day a fisherman brings them in on his boat just like in Alex's dream. Are
they dead or are just sleeping or unconscious?
// There is a fisherman in the dead dolphin scene and in Alex's dream. What is
their significance in the story? What do they represent?
