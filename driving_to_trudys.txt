Having told her fiancee that she needs to postpone the wedding and take a break
Betty decides that she prefers to drive to California rather than fly.

Betty drummed her fingers on the counter top while the sales assistant took away
her license and credit card meaning to return with her car keys. It wasn't that
she was frustrated or impatient but just a habit that she had. Often she wasn't 
even aware that she was doing it. The assistant at Hertz in Jersey City returned
with her keys for a Volvo S80 family saloon. He handed her the documents along 
with her credit card and license. She had rented cars before but not for such a
long journey so she wanted to make sure that this one was fit for purpose. Not
too flash but smooth and easy to drive. The assistant shook hands with her and
wished her a pleasant journey.

It was only a month after her sister's death and her family had urged her to 
stay and have her wedding but due to the recent news that she had received she
could no longer remain within the confines of her family and friends. Steve had
found it very hard but consented after being reassured that she was coming back.
She had been away on business trips before so what was the big deal? But to him
it didn't feel right. Gaining their consent to take a break was only the first 
step, convincing them that she needed to drive there was another thing entirely.
Being a lawyer though she was able to list enough good arguments get them to 
shrug and nod.

As the crow flies the trip would be around forty hours or more but she wanted a
relaxing trip. The drive was going to be part of the break rather than just a 
journey. She wasn't going to drive through the night but stay at motels and 
get a good nights sleep between each days drive. Take in a little tourism here
and there and generally be with herself. No work, no family, no friends and no
fiancee. Would that make her vulnerable? Probably not. She had a pretty tough 
exterior.

Having removed her suitcases from her own car she placed them into the boot of
her rented Volvo and placed her handbag on the passenger seat. She got a feel
of the controls and nosed it out of the parking bay toward the Pulaski Skyway
which would take her through Newark and the I78 to Harrisburg and then I76 to
Pittsburgh. Then the I70 to Columbus. She could probably make that by the end
of the day at an easy pace especially as it was still early. She was thinking
that it would take four full days of driving without pushing herself too 
hard. It was nice to finally let go and relax. Or so she thought for it was 
far from relaxing. 

So much to think about and so many miles to think about it. Sunglasses, cruise
control and whatever local radio station she happened to passing. She wanted to
feel part of wherever she was. There was a lot of traffic on the roads but it
was all flowing quite freely. She gripped the steering wheel gently and let
the car do the work as she merely nudged it now and again. 

Gradually her thoughts began to drift away from the practicalities to all that 
she was holding back. Her sister only dead one month, the Al Quaeda attacks, 
her family and fiancee missing her and of course the breast cancer. One of 
these events would have been enough for anyone but she had to deal with them 
all at the same time. She couldn't of course, she needed help and that was why
she was going to see Trudy. But it wasn't like her. She rose to the challenge
and faced whatever needed to be faced. But her world was falling apart, quite
literally. Some would have simply curled up and died and even though she didn't
want to admit it she had felt like that a few times. That had scared her. It 
wasn't like her but then all the recent events weren't familiar ones either.

She recalled war stories her grandfather had recounted where buildings had been
reduced to rubble and close friends had died. But they just had to move on for
their own survival. Those stories suddenly came alive and no longer seemed to
her like old people talking about the war. They had hoped that their children 
would never have to experience such destruction but there it was happening to
her.

Betty couldn't really focus on any particular sets of feelings. They were all
a mish-mash of random sensations that bubbled to the surface and waved for a 
little while till they sank under again. Flashes of times spent playing with
her sister, of the early days with Steve and the very recent ones. Her folks
pleading with her to stay and be part of the family and to see this thing 
through together. They had just lost a daughter and wanted to be with the
one that still remained. Her boss telling her that she could take as long as
she needed but wondering if that meant he thought that she was weak. But the
thought that kept returning over and over again was the mammogram and the sound
of the doctor's voice as he handed her the results. In her imagination she 
could hear only the sound but not the words. As though she had water in her
ears or earplugs. There was too much background noise amongst the mass of 
thoughts and emotions to really focus on any particular scene.

Just after Harrisburg she took a pit stop. She leafed through the literature
from the doctor but seemed to be staring at the page rather than reading it.
