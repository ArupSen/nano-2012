Having told her fiancee that she needs to postpone the wedding and take a break
Betty decides that she prefers to drive to California rather than fly.

Betty drummed her fingers on the counter top while the sales assistant took away
her license and credit card meaning to return with her car keys. It wasn't that
she was frustrated or impatient but just a habit that she had. Often she wasn't 
even aware that she was doing it. The assistant at Hertz in Jersey City returned
with her keys for a Volvo S80 family saloon. He handed her the documents along 
with her credit card and license. She had rented cars before but not for such a
long journey so she wanted to make sure that this one was fit for purpose. Not
too flash but smooth and easy to drive. The assistant shook hands with her and
wished her a pleasant journey.

It was only a month after her sister's death and her family had urged her to 
stay and have her wedding but due to the recent news that she had received she
could no longer remain within the confines of her family and friends. Steve had
found it very hard but consented after being reassured that she was coming back.
She had been away on business trips before so what was the big deal? But to him
it didn't feel right. Gaining their consent to take a break was only the first 
step, convincing them that she needed to drive there was another thing entirely.
Being a lawyer though she was able to list enough good arguments get them to 
shrug and nod.

As the crow flies the trip would be around forty hours or more but she wanted a
relaxing trip. The drive was going to be part of the break rather than just a 
journey. She wasn't going to drive through the night but stay at motels and 
get a good nights sleep between each days drive. Take in a little tourism here
and there and generally be with herself. No work, no family, no friends and no
fiancee. Would that make her vulnerable? Probably not. She had a pretty tough 
exterior.

Having removed her suitcases from her own car she placed them into the boot of
her rented Volvo and placed her handbag on the passenger seat. She got a feel
of the controls and nosed it out of the parking bay toward the Pulaski Skyway
which would take her through Newark and the I78 to Harrisburg and then I76 to
Pittsburgh. Then the I70 to Columbus. She could probably make that by the end
of the day at an easy pace especially as it was still early.
