Having told her fiancee that she needs to postpone the wedding and take a break
Betty decides that she prefers to drive to California rather than fly.
WC - 4743

Betty drummed her fingers on the counter top while the sales assistant took away
her license and credit card meaning to return with her car keys. It wasn't that
she was frustrated or impatient but just a habit that she had. Often she wasn't 
even aware that she was doing it. The assistant at Hertz in Jersey City returned
with her keys for a Volvo S80 family saloon. He handed her the documents along 
with her credit card and license. She had rented cars before but not for such a
long journey so she wanted to make sure that this one was fit for purpose. Not
too flash but smooth and easy to drive. The assistant shook hands with her and
wished her a pleasant journey.

It was only a month after her sister's death and her family had urged her to 
stay and have her wedding but due to the recent news that she had received she
could no longer remain within the confines of her family and friends. Steve had
found it very hard but consented after being reassured that she was coming back.
She had been away on business trips before so what was the big deal? But to him
it didn't feel right. Gaining their consent to take a break was only the first 
step, convincing them that she needed to drive there was another thing entirely.
Being a lawyer though she was able to list enough good arguments get them to 
shrug and nod.

As the crow flies the trip would be around forty hours or more but she wanted a
relaxing trip. The drive was going to be part of the break rather than just a 
journey. She wasn't going to drive through the night but stay at motels and 
get a good nights sleep between each days drive. Take in a little tourism here
and there and generally be with herself. No work, no family, no friends and no
fiancee. Would that make her vulnerable? Probably not. She had a pretty tough 
exterior.

Having removed her suitcases from her own car she placed them into the boot of
her rented Volvo and placed her handbag on the passenger seat. She got a feel
of the controls and nosed it out of the parking bay toward the Pulaski Skyway
which would take her through Newark and the I78 to Harrisburg and then I76 to
Pittsburgh. Then the I70 to Columbus. She could probably make that by the end
of the day at an easy pace especially as it was still early. She was thinking
that it would take four full days of driving without pushing herself too 
hard. It was nice to finally let go and relax. Or so she thought for it was 
far from relaxing. 

So much to think about and so many miles to think about it. Sunglasses, cruise
control and whatever local radio station she happened to passing. She wanted to
feel part of wherever she was. There was a lot of traffic on the roads but it
was all flowing quite freely. She gripped the steering wheel gently and let
the car do the work as she merely nudged it now and again. 

Gradually her thoughts began to drift away from the practicalities to all that 
she was holding back. Her sister only dead one month, the Al Quaeda attacks, 
her family and fiancee missing her and of course the breast cancer. One of 
these events would have been enough for anyone but she had to deal with them 
all at the same time. She couldn't of course, she needed help and that was why
she was going to see Trudy. But it wasn't like her. She rose to the challenge
and faced whatever needed to be faced. But her world was falling apart, quite
literally. Some would have simply curled up and died and even though she didn't
want to admit it she had felt like that a few times. That had scared her. It 
wasn't like her but then all the recent events weren't familiar ones either.

She recalled war stories her grandfather had recounted where buildings had been
reduced to rubble and close friends had died. But they just had to move on for
their own survival. Those stories suddenly came alive and no longer seemed to
her like old people talking about the war. They had hoped that their children 
would never have to experience such destruction but there it was happening to
her.

Betty couldn't really focus on any particular sets of feelings. They were all
a mish-mash of random sensations that bubbled to the surface and waved for a 
little while till they sank under again. Flashes of times spent playing with
her sister, of the early days with Steve and the very recent ones. Her folks
pleading with her to stay and be part of the family and to see this thing 
through together. They had just lost a daughter and wanted to be with the
one that still remained. Her boss telling her that she could take as long as
she needed but wondering if that meant he thought that she was weak. But the
thought that kept returning over and over again was the mammogram and the sound
of the doctor's voice as he handed her the results. In her imagination she 
could hear only the sound but not the words. As though she had water in her
ears or earplugs. There was too much background noise amongst the mass of 
thoughts and emotions to really focus on any particular scene.

Just after Harrisburg she took a pit stop. She leafed through the literature
from the doctor but seemed to be staring at the page rather than reading it.
Was it really true? Was this her? Was she just reading an article in the 
newspaper? She sipped her coffee through the little opening in the cover of 
the cup. She looked at the papers again and the x-ray print. It was starting
to sink in. She could feel something inside. Some sort of sensation that felt
somewhat alien. A slight dizziness and a momentary blur in her vision. A good
thing she wasn't driving at the time. She didn't really know what it was but
decided to allow it to work itself through rather than try to suppress. It 
could come back when she was driving. She wasn't a psychologist but she did
believe in the subconscious mind and guessed that this was something coming up
from there and that who we are and how we are all comes from that place that
most people refer to as the subconscious mind. It was probably the best 
strategy. If she got the shakes while she was driving or started to get blurry
vision then it could be fatal. She didn't want to die like that. She took one
more sip of coffee and pretended that everything was fine. She didn't really
want to have any interactions or people asking her if she was OK.

Back in car she felt like she wanted to move. Energy from the coffee perhaps 
or just feeling a little ashamed at having felt something that showed that she
was weak. But it was time to put her foot down and start going a little faster.
She stuck to route 76 and drove for 2 hours straight. A bit faster than she had
anticipated but having done a little looking within herself she decided that 
she needed to get back to the real world for a while. A dead sister, a wedding
on hold and possibly not long to live. A lot to process. One thing at a time.
Pittsburgh wasn't too far away, probably another hour or so. But she could 
feel another tremor coming. It seemed bigger this time. Time for another short
stop.

Not a long stop this time. A small car park with a couple of picnic benches and
a sign with details about the local area and walking routes. But there were
toilets and a rubbish bin. She used the toilet and sat for a while breathing
deeply. Something was happening and she sensed that it was better not to fight
it. She imagined how this would have looked if it had happened on the plane.
Death. It was death. He sister had died and now it was her turn. How long did
she have? She didn't really want to think about it but the thoughts and feelings
kept pushing their way to the front of the crowd. She didn't like the way it 
was going but she felt good about the way she was dealing with it. It was like
she was leaking and if she could hold out long enough to get to Trudy's place
then she would be fine. She knew all about feelings and emotions and how to 
deal with what drives us from deep down.

A light snack in the car before hitting the road again. Radio on loud with some
upbeat pop music and onward to Columbus. She was in a driving mood and didn't 
want to go into Pittsburgh and changed from route 76 to route 70. This would 
take her all the way there. She had taken it easy earlier in the day so it was
already early evening but she wanted to push on before finding a motel and 
Columbus seemed like a good target for that day. She wanted to call Trudy about
what had happened that day but as they were 2 hours ahead on the West Coast she
thought that perhaps she shouldn't disturb her. An urgent toilet break caused
her to stop again. She didn't really want to especially as it was dark but she
really couldn't hold it much longer. She was getting low on fuel anyway. 
Columbus was very close but she was close to wetting her pants. A small garage
in Buckeye Lake. Then refreshed she continued on to Columbus arriving only a 
few minutes later. She drove to the West side of town before finding a motel.

There were plenty of rooms and it was just off the freeway so it would easy to
get going again in the morning. She took her cases into the room and lay down
on the bed with her arms out wide. It was only 10pm and that was midnight in
California. Maybe Trudy was still awake? She took off her shoes and turned on
the heating. It was some rickety thing on the wall with many layers of paint.
She rubbed her hands together as the unit got up to speed. She stood with her
back to it and closed her eyes to enjoy the full effect of the warmth. Shower,
that's what she wanted. But she knew that once she got in there she wasn't 
going to get out for a while. She decided to try Trudy first.

She used the motel room phone and put her mobile phone on charge. She had 
changed out of her jeans into her pyjama bottoms to help her wind down after
her long drive. She found some menus distributed on the table top and phoned
for a pizza. Pepperoni with salad and coke. Keep it simple. That way it might
arrive a little faster. After snacking all day she could feel the hunger.

She called Trudy. Trudy answered. 
"Sorry to call so late. You about to go to bed?", asked Betty.
"No, not yet. I'm a bit of a night bird so it's ok if you want to talk."
Trudy was tired but she was trying to be accommodating.
"It won't be a long one as I've only just arrived and haven't showered yet."
"Eww. I'm glad I'm not in that room with you", teased Trudy.
"What do you mean?", asked Betty chuckling.
"Oh, fragrant flowers I'm sure. So where are you?" asked Trudy.
"I'm in Columbus, Ohio. Not bad for a day's drive. I was planning on taking it
a bit slower but hey, I got in the mood so I went with it."
"That is good going. How's the motel?"
"It's ok. It's cheap and it's clean and the heating works."
There was a knock at the door. That was quick she thought. 
"Hang on Trudy that's probably my pizza delivery. Be right back."
She reached for her purse and went to the door. 
"Miss Klein? Pepperoni and a salad?" asked the delivery man.
"Yes, that's correct."
"Seven bucks eighty maam."
She paid and closed the door and went straight back to the phone. She opened the
coke and took a sip. 
"Sorry about that. I'm so hungry. Didn't hit me all day but now I can really feel
it."
"What you got?"
"Pepperoni and salad. Do you mind if I eat while we talk?"
"Sure. Bon appetit."
The pizza was already sliced so she pulled out a wedge and took a big bite and 
then another sip of coke. She couldn't find any napkins so she wiped her hand on
the motel towel. I'm paying for this she thought. She took another big bite but
chewed it quickly as she was aware that Trudy was on the other end of the line.
"So what's on your mind? You didn't call just to tell me about the motel. Did 
something happen?"
Betty took another swallow before she answered.
"I was looking at the papers I got from the doctor and I got all dizzy and shaky.
I felt a bit faint and you know like a mild sense of panic."
"What did you do?"
"Nothing really. I just sort of let it happen. I figured that it was better to
let it happen at a pit stop rather than while I was driving and that it could
happen again if I didn't let it out."
"Good plan. So what was this paper you got from the doctor?"
"I don't want to talk about that right now. I'll tell you when I get there."
"OK".
"But it happpend again later on and it was stronger. I mean I really think I 
would have crashed the car".
"Oh god. You OK?"
"I'm fine. Now that I'm in my room and warm and with my dinner."
"Look, why don't you take the train the rest of the way?"
"Can you imagine how it would feel to be going through that and have strangers
around you?"
"Yeah, I guess. Well, take it easy anyway. And maybe don't look at those papers
till you get here. Whatever they are."
"OK. That sounds sensible."
"I'll have a good night's sleep and hopefully should be fine tomorrow. They were
against me driving. And this is the first time I've had a break so it could be 
that."
"Flying probably wouldn't have been quicker especially with all these security 
checks going on right now. I bet they're pissed at you for missing Thanksgiving
too."
"I told them I'd be back by then."
"Yeah right. That's really going to happen."
"You're right."
"Um. I am feeling a little tired actually. It's coming up to one am now. I have
client in the morning."
"Ok, no problem. Thanks for listening."
"Sure, anytime. I'm available during the day too. So call me if you get any more
of those little episodes, OK."
"Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow."
"Well. I wish you a very good night Betty."
"Goodnight Trudy."
Betty put down the phone and saw that there was more than half her pizza remaining
and it was getting cold. She was still hungry though so she worked her way through
it. Wolfed down the salad and the rest of the coke. She hadn't finished chewing
the last mouthful before she headed for the bathroom and turned on the shower. A 
powerful stream of very hot water. Just what she wanted and what she needed. She 
stayed in there for a long time and the water stayed as hot and as powerful as 
it had began. When she got out she could feel the drowsiness hitting her and she
didn't try and fight it. Before long it was lights out.

She did have a good night's sleep and tried to grab a hold of fragments of 
dreams but they slipped away. She hadn't set her alarm but she was up at 6.30
and even though that was only five and a half hours she felt quite fresh and
awake. She got dressed, put the cases in the car and handed back her motel key.
Time to hit the road. She looked at the map and realised that she had only 
travelled about a quarter of the distance. At this rate she would be spending
more time on the road than with Trudy. She resolved to make good progress and
cover a substantial distance. Kansas City. She put her finger down firmly on
the map. It would be a full day's drive with hardly any breaks but it was 
possible. She felt more confident today and the episodes from the previous day
seemed as though they had happened in the distant past.

It was a clear day without a cloud in the sky. She put the car into drive and 
nosed out of the motel parking and made her way to the I70 again. She would 
just need to remain on the same road to take her all the way to Kansas City.
No junctions, no intersections, no turns. Easy. She was planning to stop for
snacks, coffee and toilet of course but no long breaks. She figured that with
the cruise control and open roads the whole thing would be a bit of a break.
Yesterday had been a tough day but that was the first and a kind of breaking
in day. Today would be easier. She could feel it. The radio was on and she had
a few mini doughnuts from the previous day. A little on the dry side but still
pretty tasty. Indianapolis was the next stop. With the cruise control she was
feeling confident enough today to take off her shoes and put her feet up on
the seat and cross her legs. Kind of dangerous so it was a bold move. But it
did show that she felt on top of things. She sang along to the radio and made
some subtle dance movements while she kept her hands on the wheel. She didn't
bother changing lane or overtaking as there weren't many others on the road.

Indianapolis. She stopped for around 20 minutes. Long enough to fill up the
car, get coffee, use the toilet and stock up on a few snacks. She bought enough
to see her through the day in case she had to stop somewhere that was busy or
if she just didn't really want to stop for very long. She smiled to herself
that she was doing well and got back in the car for the next leg. Same drill,
radio, cruise control and feet up on the seat. The radio wasn't so good this
time and there was a bit more traffic. This slightly grated on her but it
didn't last for long. And the music improved too, at least to her taste. She
had held out without a smoke for a good long while so it was time to light up.
A smoker is always a smoker even when they don't smoke however long that may 
last. This required a stop though as she didn't want to smoke out the hire
car and she didn't like the smell of stale smoke. She stopped at a picnic
table a little way after Effingham with St. Louis only a short distance away.
She was one of those smokers who were able to cut back quite easily without the
least bit of effort. But just like most smokers that wouldn't last too long.
The yearning would return soon enough. She admired the scenery and watched the
cars drive both ways. So many shapes and sizes. Where were they all going? Were
there any that were going exactly the same way? Perhaps even the same 
destination. It was possible. Her head began to spin a little and she waited it
out. Her hands trembled a little but she put it down to the nicotine. She 
imagined some pain around her left breast but it was only her imagination.

With her break over she sped on towards St. Louis. It wasn't too long before
she arrived. She had a craving for a fizzy carbonated drink so she bought one.
A big one in a tall cup with a straw so it would easy to drink while driving.
She stopped for a slightly longer time at St. Louis just to stretch a little
and move around. She didn't want a big meal but made herself eat something a 
bit more substantial than the little snacks she had gathered earlier that day.
It wasn't physically demanding as such but she figured that proper nutrition 
was always a good idea. The long break was only a fraction more than her 
cigarette break and she wondered whether she should push on beyond Kansas city
as she was making such good progress. Her mood could change the following day
or there could be traffic. Strike while the iron was hot. She pushed on and 
when she got to Kansas City it was already starting to get darker but just at
the point where one might turn on the lights. Driving a Volvo her lights were
permanently on so she didn't even need to consider it. Her current plan was
to keep going till she was tired or bored. It could mean having to stay in a
motel in a small town but she was feeling game so she continued. Through 
Kansas City and Topeka to the West of it. Straight through Junction City and
Abilene. Was she going to continue to Denver? She got to Salina and got out
for a cigarette. At a small roadside diner she got coffee and flicked through
a newspaper that someone had left. People outside of New York weren't so 
affected by the attacks on the World Trade Center and for them their small
towns were their whole world. This was one of the main reasons she didn't want
to stop in these places. She finished her cheesecake and gulped down her last
mouthful of coffee. She was starting to feel tired in spite of the caffeine.
Should she keep driving or should she call it a day and find somewhere to sleep?

Back on the road she felt awake. The roads were quiet and it was only late 
evening and not even the early hours. She didn't want to admit it to herself
but perhaps she could make it to Denver. But wouldn't that cut into the next
day? Wouldn't that mean getting up late and missing the morning? Didn't matter
she was on holiday now. No obligation to conform to any routine. Denver it was
then. Same old I70 and she clung to it like a mollusc. She could have gone on
all night but 3.00 am was far enough. She'd made it to Denver and Betty decided
to stop and take a rest. She drove through the city and made her way to the West
side as that would have been much slower during the day time. She found a motel
in the Lakewood area and hit the hay. No shower, no brushing of teeth or putting
on her pyjamas. T-shirt and panties. She got up a moment later to check that the
door was properly closed but then sleep took over and she didn't stir again till
after 10.00 am the following morning.

She could easily have slept longer. Caffeine keeps you up the night before but
makes you drowsy on the morning after. So she needed more. She could rest all 
she needed in the car so after a quick shower she was back in the car for the 
third day. Only about a quarter of a tank but plenty of snacks. She sipped on 
the drink that was pretty flat by now. Sickly sweet. She sipped it anyway. Gave
her a road feeling. A few mouthfuls of crisps, not ideal breakfast food but it
gave her the boost she needed. Lethargy could be just around the corner if she
wasn't careful. It was possible to make it all the way today and she wanted to
keep her head together rather than need another day. She was sort of enjoying
her trip but she was also yearning to see her friend try to make sense of 
what was happening to her.

She headed North on the I25 to Cheyenne and then West on the I80 towards Salt
Lake City. She could have taken the 40 and got to see the forests but better
to be on a bigger and straighter road. Especially going long distance like 
this. It still offered some great views but she was starting to get bored of
the scenery and generally irritable. Feeling a little restless as well she was
in need of something to do. No more feet on the seat. She decided to push the 
speed but not too much. No sense in getting a fine.

There were some short rain showers but nothing major. With just a couple of 
short stops she pushed on to Salt Lake City. The road was pretty clear and she
didn't have any more episodes. That was quite a relief. That made her feel a 
bit more confident and less anxious about having an accident. It was early 
afternoon by the time she was passing through Salt Lake City. She didn't stop
for long, only to take a late lunch. Today she was hungry and went for a full
spread at a roadside diner: burger, fries and salad. That ought to keep her
going. It did make her feel a little drowsy but nothing a cup of coffee could
not solve.

She stayed on the I80 and drove on to Reno. A little rush hour traffic but no
major jams. After Reno it was the Tahoe National Forest by which time it was
starting to get dark. She was wondering about stopping at another motel but
it wasn't too far now. But suddenly the tiredness hit her. It was as though
her body had been holding out all this time and now it couldn't wait any 
longer. She stopped for a break at Sacramento and called Trudy. 
"Hi Trudy, it's Betty. I'm in Sacramento. It's pretty late already so I'm like
wondering if I should get a room and come over in the morning?"
"Betty, I don't mind, really. You can come late. But how're you feeling? I mean
you've been driving all day. Maybe you could do with a rest?"
"I'm OK. Sure, I'm a little tired but it's only a couple more hours or so".
"Well, if you think you're up to it. Don't worry about waking me if I do fall
asleep."
"Shit, I feel bad now. OK, I'll get a room. I can see me getting lost and 
falling asleep at the wheel."
"That wouldn't be good at all. OK, you get a good night's rest and I'll see 
you in the morning."
"OK. I'm really looking forward to it."
"Bye Betty".
"See you tomorrow".
She put down the phone and sighed. Betty was so looking forward to seeing Trudy
this evening. It was what had kept her going. It was boring but it was a very
sensible thing to do. She found a motel just off the Harbor Boulevard and got
into bed fairly quickly. After her big lunch she wasn't too hungry so she just
nibbled on some of the snacks that she had left over in the car. It was starting
to look a little messy in there. She wanted to make an early start so she cleared
it out and asked for a wake up call. They would also provide coffee and doughnuts.
She thought about phoning Trudy again but better just to get to sleep and see her
in person which after all was the reason for this trip.
