Following the first day at Trudy's up to the hospital date a week later.
WC - 1847 

When Betty woke up the next morning she wasn't quite sure where she was. The 
past few days had been in motels so she looked out of the window to check on her
car. It was still there but she couldn't see any other cars. The decor of the 
room seemed very different to any motel in which she had stayed. Suddenly she
remembered. She looked at her watch. It read 7.12. She went out of her room and
looked to see if Trudy was up. She couldn't find her. Benjy was asleep on the 
porch but there was no sign of Trudy. Perhaps she had an early morning client.
She went to the door of the therapy room but could hear nothing and there was
no smell of incense. The door to Trudy's room was slightly open so she gently
swung it open a little further to see inside. She saw Trudy at the far end of
the room sitting upright with her eyes closed and motionless. Whatever she was
doing Betty didn't want to disturb her. She went back into her own room and 
quietly unpacked her running things and got changed. She quietly slipped out
of the door and started with a fast walk to warm up. The tide was out leaving
a trail of seaweed and shells just inside the shoreline. She stepped up the 
pace to one that was as fast as she could walk. She swung her arms to get her
shoulders warm. It was certainly warmer than New York there but at that time
in the morning it still felt chilly. The walk was starting to warm her. When
she felt that she had walked for long enough she began to do wide skipping 
movements in the manner of a triple jumper. This was to build up some spring
in her stride and to warm up her ankles. She hadn't been running for four days
which is a long time for someone who has it as part of their routine. She 
could feel her legs aching for the stride and the rhythm that they had missed.
A few minutes of the skipping was all it took to launch her into a run. It was
a fast jog rather than a slow run. She went in the same direction they had been
the previous day to have lunch at Captain Joe's. When she passed it she saw 
that it was already open and that people had arrived for their morning coffee.
Did he also sell pastries? She figured that if stopped there on the way home
she could grab a couple of apple danishes to take home. She kept on going and
found another stretch of deserted beach. She ran further than she would on her
normal work days. It seemed like she was getting back to the routine that she
had established during her leave period but this was only the first day. She
continued well beyond Bodega Bay and all the way up to Fort Ross before deciding
to turn back. She didn't really know what Trudy had planned for the day and she
might need to go out which would mean that she would stuck outside. She had her
car keys but Trudy hadn't given her a house key yet. She doubled back to Captain
Joe's in Bodega Bay and found that they did indeed serve pastries for the 
rush. Joe recognised her immediately and joked that Trudy rarely came for 
breakfast. When she left Captain Joe's she felt more reassured that Trudy would
still be at home. When she arrived back to her house on Dillon Beach she saw 
that Trudy was up on the porch with her cup and looking out to sea.
"Hey Trudy. Look what I got. Apple danishes. You ready for breakfast?" she asked
feeling right at home. Trudy smiled and nodded. She handed them to Trudy to
inspect. 
"I got them at Captain Joe's. He said you never went there for breakfast. Smell
good don't they. I'm gonna take a shower real quick, OK?" Betty was gone before
Trudy had a chance to answer. She put the pastries on a plate and made a coffee
for Betty and brought it out to the little coffee table on the porch. Benjy got
up and wagged his tail. It was time for his breakfast too. True to her word 
Betty returned dressed in jeans and a blouse. Her hair was still wet but it was
warm enough to let it air dry. Betty was pleased to see the cafetiere of coffee
on the table but noticed that Trudy was having another herbal infusion probably
camomile.
"Morning", said Trudy,"someone has their energy back I see".
Betty gave her a confused look. And waited for Trudy to speak again.
"You slept for three hours in the afternoon yesterday and you were in bed again
only an hour after dinner. I would say that was a tired person. But not today it
seems."
"I was up at my usual hour and followed my usual routine that's all. Is that 
strange?" asked Betty.
"I'm just messing with you. I figured you might sleep for a little longer that's
all. I didn't know you ran. Not really my thing else I'd go with you but round
here is a great place for it. Some stunning views and not much traffic at all."
"There was some traffic up in Bodega Bay with people getting their morning 
coffees."
"So you got pastries from Captain Joe's. Yeah, I never go there in the mornings.
I usually have a smoothie. We could have that too if you like. I just put a lot
of fruit into a blender. Real easy."
"Sure, sounds nice" said Betty take a bite of her danish and sipping her coffee.
"So you don't drink coffee?" asked Betty.
"Sometimes, but not that often. I like coffee but I'm not one of those people 
that needs it. More recreational rather than a necessity."
"I need it. Can't go a day without my coffee. Sure glad that you have good 
coffee. Thanks for making it by the way, especially as you're not having any
yourself."
"That's OK. You're my guest. Which reminded me that I haven't given you a key."
"I was thinking the same too when I ran past Bodega Bay the first time. I got 
scared that you might have gone out and I wouldn't be able to get in."
"Here you go. It's got both keys on there." said Trudy.
"That's great. Thanks. You got plans for today?" asked Betty.
"No plans at all, just a lazy Sunday. I usually get the paper, go for a walk.
Sometimes I go into Santa Rosa. I guess we should do a little shopping. Two 
mouths to feed now".
"What, are you pregnant?" teased Betty. 
Trudy hit her with a cushion."Shut up".
They both laughed. The sea was choppy today and they both looked out for a 
moment. 
"Trudy, do you sleep sitting up?" asked Betty, "only I saw you sitting upright
with your eyes closed when I checked to see if you were awake".
"I was meditating", chuckled Trudy, "you never seen anyone meditating before?"
"Sure, I've seen monks on TV but that's like far East. I mean I don't know of
anyone that does it so it kind of took me by surprise. I thought that either 
you were sleeping in a special way or you were doing something else. But I 
figured it was best not to disturb you." Betty was confused.
"I started doing it with my acupuncture training and then it was also something
that they recommended with Taekwondo. It really helps you to focus and get 
connected with who you are and how you are."
"What do you do? Do you blank your mind? Is it some kind of trance?" asked 
Betty, still unable to see it in a Western context.
"It's not so much what you do but what you allow to happen. Essentially you
just stay calm and observe your experience. Your thoughts, your emotions, your
senses and other mental events".
"That's kinda what I've been doing the last few days during my trip. Would you
call that meditation?" asked Betty hopefully.
"I guess you could. Yeah. I mean what I do is more of a formal technique but if
the end result is the same then yeah, why not." Trudy wasn't going to explain
too much if Betty was skeptical. She wasn't prepared to defend herself first 
thing in the morning and argue the case for meditation when she felt no need to
justify what she did.
"I can explain the basics to you sometime if you want." offered Trudy.
"Sure. Yeah. I find your whole life fascinating. It's so different from mine.
Especially as we went to college together and have come from similar backgrounds
you know. How the paths of our lives have diverged."
"Well it was all after Gary died like I said. Before that I was a lot more 
mainstream and conventional."
"Does that make me conventional?" asked Betty.
"What I mean is the majority. Most of the population of this country don't live
like I do. They do a 9-5 job and get drunk at the weekend. They watch TV every
evening and eat a lot of pizza and go to the movies." Betty gave her a look.
"OK, not everyone but I'm trying to describe the lifestyles of the majority of
the population of the US of A. You don't agree?"
"Yeah, I guess you're right. Kinda what I've been thinking too but I haven't 
made that jump yet. You know from thinking about it to actually doing something
about it."
"Sure. But you're looking back at my life and it looks like I've taken all these
logical steps leading from one point to the next. But they weren't really 
planned out that way. A lot of the things that happened were accidental. I had
an acupuncture treatment and then got into the whole thing. I mean not everyone
who has treatments do that. Then the Shiatsu and the herbs were part of that.
There was no way of knowing beforehand that I would develop such a passion for 
it. I mean you had a treatment yesterday; do you feel like taking it up?"
"It was great treatment and I've never experienced anything like that before. I
would like to know a little more about it but just a cursory interest. What you
might tell me would be enough I guess."
"So you see, a lot of chance events that really couldn't have been planned or 
predicted. But when you look back you get this impression that I chose all of
the steps quite deliberately. That wasn't the case at all."
Betty nodded in acknowledgement and deliberated.
"I'm gonna go make that smoothie. You still want some?" asked Trudy.
"Yeah, sure."
