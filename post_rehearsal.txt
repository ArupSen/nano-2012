After the rehearsal Betty decides that she need to get away for a while
WC - 

When they left the church Betty and Steve walked down the steps silently and hailed
a cab to take them home. They remained silent until they were inside their apartment
and there was an agressive changing of clothes and avoiding each others gaze. Betty
made coffee and put it on the table near the window. She was rubbing her palms on
her thighs anxiously waiting for Steve to come and join her. She wanted to have a
civilised conversation with him rather than a shouting match. He sat down opposite
Betty and poured out his own cup and stirred in the milk. He watched her hands move
on her thighs and then stop when she noticed that he was watching them. He took a
sip and looked at her but she was looking out of the window and now sitting sideways.
He sighed and broke the silence.
"Thanks for the coffee", he said politely, "you're going to explain what you did 
back there right?".
Betty nodded but still said nothing.
"I want it to come out right, OK? So just give me a minute", said Betty looking at
him and then back out the window. A moment later she turned to face him squarely
but with her knees drawn up in front of her and her arms wrapped around them.
"Steve, you remember what I said the other night don't you? I love you, I want to
marry you and I want to have a family with you. That is totally clear, OK. Are we
clear on that?" asked Betty.
"Yes", replied Steve.
"You believe me right? No doubt in your mind?" asked Betty again.
"Well, yes and no. Yes that I don't think you're lying but the fact that you just 
changed the date of the wedding does give some grounds for doubt. You know I'm
paranoid about these things and until that ring finally goes on that finger I 
will still feel that." confessed Steve.
"OK, but you saw that I didn't cancel, only postponed. I'm not running away only
deferring. You get that right?", asked Betty needing to be sure of Steve's side
before proceeding any further.
"I get that you did that but not why", answered Steve.
It was clear that no amount of reassurance was going to dislodge his paranoia.
"OK, well, I've told you I want to marry you and I've told you that I will and I
guess there isn't any mor assurances I can give you. You just have to trust that
I'll be there when the day comes. But I'm making you a promise on that and I hope
that will be enough for you". Betty made the same point again to see if it had
gone through.
"Right. OK. You've made me a promise. You can do no more I guess." He nodded to
himself and Betty could see that the penny had dropped. Now it was time to explain
why.
"I'll now tell you why", said Betty, "because I'm a mess. I still need time to get
over Anne's death and this shit at work is driving me crazy. All this infighting
and trying to save face. I wish I could just walk out of there and never go back."
Steve looked at her in amazement. He always thought that Betty loved her job and
that right now she was doing everything in her power to protect her place. This 
was the first time he had heard her say anything against it. As far as Betty was
concerned it was working. She needed to convince him that the reason for her 
need to postpone the wedding was ongoing grief and the pressure at work. Then the
cancer could be left out of it. She continued to explain about how factions had 
been formed and those who had been predicted to be on the firing list were indeed
fired. It was a hostile environment covered with cheesy grins. She told that was
one of the reasons why she was cautious about talking about the pregnancy as it
would be a mark against her. He began to realise that it wasn't really a problem
with her job but with the atmosphere there. It wasn't like that where he worked
even though cutbacks were happening there too. They were more supportive of each
other. Steve understood Betty's situation and also felt included in her world.

The next part he didn't like much. Instead of staying in New York Betty wanted
to leave town for a few days, perhaps a week. She just needed a change of scene
and away from her whole life. Everything. But just for a little while. With more
reassurances and explanations Steve finally understood Betty's reasons but he 
still didn't like her going away. He even thought of taking time off to go with
her.
