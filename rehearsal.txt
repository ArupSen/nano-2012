Betty manages to keep her cancer diagnosis a secret right up to her wedding 
rehearsal but then postpones the wedding
WC - 1640 

For two more days Betty went to work and followed her normal workday routine and
then arrived at the weekend. For those two days she had kept her news to herself.
In a week's time her wedding was taking place and today was the rehearsal. They
had originally planned to have a big wedding with friends coming from all over
but after the trade center attacks they wondered if they should postpone their
plans. First of all they decided that they would still continue with big wedding
idea but wait till everything had calmed down. But then Anne's death meant that
many of the would be guests attended her funeral. So they put everything on hold.
But Steve decided that the wedding was really for them, him and her and that the
guests didn't matter too much. He wanted to go ahead on the original date and 
take his vows with Betty and show some strength that he would not be beaten down
by adversity. Some friends thought this was in bad taste and others couldn't 
make it because lots of flights were cancelled or severely delayed due to the
security. Everything had been booked and ordered so why put it off. All that was
required was cut back on a few things and have a more intimate ceremony and 
reception. Steve needed this because he needed things to go as planned. He could
not handle too many unexpected events and too many changes of plan. He still had
his job and his girl in spite of the city being turned upside down. He said that
he needed to appreciate what he had and his way of doing that was to hold on more
tightly to it. For him, getting married was the ideal move. For Betty it was a 
way to keep him quiet and right now keep her distracted. She didn't want to think
about things right now. There were too many things. 

It was Saturday morning and Betty and Steve weren't about to do what they usually
did at the weekend. They were up early and they were going through their vows.
Steve took his suit off the hanger but didn't remove it from the plastic. That 
was for the following week, this week he would wear one of his regular suits. He
had had his haircut at lunchtime on Friday so he was feeling quite the dandy.
Betty was looking at her own dress but had it hidden inside a cover so Steve
wouldn't see it. In some ways it was just a formality as they had been living
together for a while but she was looking forward to the pomp and the ceremony.
She looked through her evening dresses and chose something that might be fitting
for a registry office wedding where the full bridal attire wouldn't be suitable.
When they had chosen their clothes they looked through their vows. It was still 
early and Betty wanted to go for a run. Steve was a little anxious and wondered
if that would give them enough time. Betty needed a run. She told him that she
would go for a short run and take a very quick shower and get changed as soon
as she was back. He agreed but continued fussing over getting the whole thing
right. Good thing it was the rehearsal rather than the wedding. 

Betty ran at a slightly faster pace to get the same sort of workout that she got
from her usual morning run. But this was Saturday and usually she ran for longer.
She felt that she was being cheated from her routine. The moment she was alone 
she was thinking about the cancer again. The words of the doctor telling her that
she would have to have one breast removed and then begin a course of chemotherapy.
But what if she didn't do that then what? How long would it be before the cancer 
would consume her? What did most people do? Did they all have the treatment? Was
there a choice? It wasn't time to think about this, it was time to pretend that
it wasn't happening. She ran faster and faster till the force of her breathing 
was causing a burning sensation in her chest. Still she pushed on till there just
was not enough oxygen coming into her body and it just stopped breathing heavily
and forcefully even though she willed herself to go on. She bent her knees and 
put her hands upon them while bending forward and continuing to breathe hard. A 
few moments later it all calmed down and she realised that she ought to be getting
back. Steve was still fussing and trying on diffent ties when she came back into
the flat. She went straight into the shower and rinsed off the sweat. Just five
minutes later she was out. She wrapped her hair in a towel and then dried off
with another towel. In the bedroom she found the dress she had chosen earlier
and chose some underwear to go with it. She put them on and then looked through
her shoes. She removed the head towel and with a brush and hairdryer worked at
getting it fully dry. When it was dry enough she started to put on the dress.
She needed steve to come and zip her up. When Steve came into the room he was
quite taken aback. Here was his bride to be. He saw her in a different way to
the Betty that he saw every day. He stopped fussing and calmed down. He did
the zipping up with care and attention and watched as she slipped into her shoes.
He had been in the process of tying his tie but hadn't quite finished it. Betty
performed that task: a wifely duty if ever there was one. 

They took a cab to the church. It was a beautiful church with stained glass 
windows and big stone steps leading up to the entrance. A church with the 
grandeur of a cathedral. They had chosen it for that very reason. Steve was more
of a religious person than Betty's family and it was through is church contacts
that they had been able to use this venue. Betty thought the venue was a pretty
one but it wasn't essential for her to be married in a church. But Steve was
a lot more traditional and for him it was a case of no church, no wedding. It was
marriage in the eyes of God. Some of the rehearsal guests had already arrived and
were gathering around the entrance. Betty's parents were there and so were Steve's.
It was as though they were getting married right then. Why had they gone to so much
trouble for the rehearsal. But there were no other guests. The parents both lived
in the city and it wasn't a great journey for them to come to this church. When
Betty saw her parents her head started to spin. The funeral came back to her and
the wake, throwing up the next day and having the time off that she did. She asked
Steve to go in and that she would follow him presently. He got worried for a moment
but soon saw her following. They had booked it for just half an hour which they 
thought was ample time to go through the ceremony. The organish was ready to play
and on the priest's signal he played the traditional wedding march. Betty walked
down the aisle holding an imaginary boquet of flowers and looking at the guests.
She came and stood next to Steve who was already there waiting. The organist 
stopped playing and the priest gave his dearly beloved speech as though the 
church was a full congregation. His voice and tone completely set the mood and
they were transported from being at a rehearsal to a wedding proper except that
he wasn't properly attired. They had no rings that day but they imagined. After
they had said their "I do's", they discussed a few things with the priest and 
confirmed the date for the following week.

It was at this point when they were all about to part company that Betty could
no longer hold back all that was within her. She wanted to shout it out at the
top of her lungs and hear it boom and echo around the walls of that church. But
even though she imagined herself doing it, not a word peeped out from her lips.
But her actions spoke louder than words. As the three couples were walking down
the aisle towards the door Betty turned around and went back to the priest and
in a matter of fact way asked him to get his diary out again. She looked Steve
straight in the face and told him that she wasn't ready. The following week 
was too soon and she needed a little longer. Postpone it for a month was what
she suggested. The priest seemed to be completely at ease as though a client
was changing a hotel booking. He checked his diary and said that it would be
fine. She turned to the others and asked them if early December would suit them.
They found their diaries and agreed that the date would suit them. But what
about Steve? He stood there silently not sure where to look. The priest took his
leave and quietly went into one of the doors. The organist began to practice a
hymn and the parents said their goodbyes quickly realising that they needed to
talk. Betty took Steve's arm and marched him out of the church.
