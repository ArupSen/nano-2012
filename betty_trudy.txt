So who is Betty and where is she from. She is from NYC but she has been living 
and working in London. I guess we need to mention 911 then. Was she involved?
What happened? Her sister died. Was she on one of the towers? No, she was below.
But yeah, need to be a bit sensitive about that. What did she do? She was a banker
or a stockbroker. Late twenties is the start of a career. Could she have been 
corporate by then? She loses her sister and soon after that finds that she has
a tumour. She goes for a scan and realises that she can't deal with all this. She
is about to get married but everything has to go on hold. Some tell her that she
has to carry on but she just can't. She has money. Not a lot but plenty to keep
her going in the Far East traveller destinations so she is off. She explains it 
all to her fiance and her parents and his parents that she needs a break. Needs 
to take a vacation for a few weeks. Just to sit on a beach and watch the sunset.
Just get away from her current life. The pressure is too much. Her fiance asks 
why she can't stay and work through it all together with the family. We're about
to get married and married people work out stuff together. Trouble shared and 
all that. But it was all too much for Betty. She needed a break, just a few weeks.
Away from work, family and friends. All that was normal and familiar. Finally
the fiance is reassured that she still wants him. I'll call you OK, I'll call 
every day Steve and I'll be home before you know it. 

A friend of hers from college lived on the West Coast so she flew out there and
that is where it started. Her friend was no longer following a normal career and
was working freelance as a masseuse. She had a place close to the beach and lived
on her own. She had a dog called Benjy and took walks along the beach. They 
walked and they talked and Betty began to see the world in a different way. 
Things started to change. Her friend Trudy was about the same age as her but was
a lot more mature or it seemed so to Betty. And at night they would sit on the 
porch and watch the sunset. It was calming and idyllic and just what she needed.
She phoned Steve early evening as they were about 3 hours ahead in California.
He was anxious but tried not to show it or talk about it. He was missing her a
lot. He knew Trudy a little bit but not what she was doing now. So he sort of 
felt safe in that knowledge. And Trudy was a girl so he wasn't jealous. But he
was jealous of Betty opening up to someone else. But it wasn't so long since 
they were last in contact so he didn't feel like he was losing her. Trudy's 
parents were both dead. They had had her when they were older and she was an
only child. But she was doing OK. Trudy meditated, did yoga and massaged to 
pay her way. Betty got one or two massages but as it was her work Trudy didn't
want to do too much of it. Or does she just love it and doesn't care? She gives
it as a gift to Betty and it calms her. She cries during the treatments. It's
a cathartic process. Then she makes a big joint on the beach. As they walk 
and talk it all comes out. Betty likes to run but Trudy doesn't. So when Betty
runs Trudy does yoga at home or on the porch and then meditates. She meditates
in the morning too if she has a client. Betty is very respectful of all this
and doesn't mock although if she was in New York with her work friends she would
have done so. Trudy doesn't try to suggest that it would be good for her or that
she should try it but says that it works for her and that is why she keeps it up.
She does it religiously but wouldn't call it a religion. So there is no form of
evangelism. They talk about Steve, about work, about her dead sister Anne and 
the family and how she will be stuck in that world now she is part of that 
establishment. The cancer is the biggest thing and it's the first time that she
has told anyone about it. She hasn't told Steve or her parents. She can't even
believe it and Trudy suggests that she makes an appointment there and gets a 
second opinion. [scene here] She has it confirmed. What will she do? How will 
she cope? Mastectomy? Chemotherapy? Hair falling out?
