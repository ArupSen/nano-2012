With lungs full of toxic dust, an amputated left leg and blood transfusion, Anne
is slowly regaining consciousness. WC - 2673

On the morning of Thursday the 13th of September 2011 at around 11.00 am Anne
began to stir and it took her a few moments to realise where she was. The walls
and decor were familiar to her but where had she seen them before? Home? No it
wasn't home. A friend's house? No, not there either. So it was work. She turned
hear head and immediately felt the oxygen mask on top of her face and then also
noticed that she was finding it difficult to breathe. She wanted a cigarette 
but that wasn't going to happen. She tried to turn her head further to see if 
there might be a pack on the nightstand but it was too painful. She tried to move
her left arm and felt the needle of the drip in there before she noticed the 
drip itself. She watched it for a moment seeing the drop growing in size till 
it got big enough to fall and trickle down. Next to this she saw something that
was hanging from the ceiling. Her eyes followed it down and she noticed and felt
it at the same time: her left leg. She tried to move it but felt very little
sensation. Her heart beat a little faster and she breathed harder. A minor 
sense of panic set in as she looked around at everything once more. She was so
used to being the one taking people to hospital that it very strange to her
to be the one now lying in the bed. With a great sense of disbelief and shock
she began to slowly take the situation on board. She was hurt, badly hurt and
she was in a hospital bed. The decor told that it was St. Vincents. Then the
scene came back to her. Feeling tired and running on adrenaline. Moving those
people out of that room and into the ambulance. She was the last one out of
there but she didn't make it. The ceiling had collapsed and trapped her there.
She didn't remember anything else. She breathed hard again and felt her eyes
closing. 

Anne had been a paramedic since her early twenties. She loved being on the scene
and being able to help right when the help was needed. She was almost 33 now 
and was very dedicated to her job. Having no husband or children she always took
the difficult shifts that the others didn't want or couldn't do. She was one of
those people who was married to her job. She was short at five feet nothing but
slim and very fit. When she wasn't working she spent her time looking after her
own fitness. She liked to run and lift weights at the gym. This wasn't in order
to have a beautiful body but to be fit for the job. She needed stamina to keep
her going when things got tough and she needed strength to lift bodies. But 
she didn't diet like most other women and she smoked and drank. She knew that
these were detrimental to her health but somewhere in her mind she figured that
if she was doing good it would cancel out the harm that she was doing to herself
by smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. The risk of going to accident sites
was much higher than the slower internal damage. Her nails were cut short but
she didn't bite them. Her hair was short too. Strawberry blond going on red 
with a grown out fringe that she blew occassionally and brushed aside with the
back of her hand.

Jack and Farookh had contacted Anne's family and told them of her condition. 
Her sister Betty had been there since early morning and her parents were due
to arrive quite soon. Betty finished her cigarette and got another coffee from
the machine before returning to Anne's room. As she turned the handle and took
another sip from her cup she noticed two paramedics sitting in the room next
to the bed. She was immediately taken aback and wondered if the situation had
got worse. 
"Oh god, is everything OK?", she asked in a mildly panicked voice.
"You must be Betty", answered Jack getting up and offering his hand,"I'm Jack
and this in Farookh. We were on Anne's crew yesterday. I believe I spoke to 
you on the phone".
"Oh hi. Pleased to meet you. Thanks for calling", she said with a slight gulp
"I sometimes forget she's a paramedic too", Betty was shaking a little and
sat down.
"The nurse told me a little", said Betty,"but not many details. Can you guys
fill me in?"
"We can tell you what happened yesterday. The three of us were pretty tired but
we knew there were more bodies. So we went back. The fire crews had excavated
a room with ten people. Some were alive and moving so we got them all out. Anne
was the last to leave when the ceiling collapsed and she got trapped under the
rubble."
"Her leg was under a big block of concrete", continued Jack,"and it took us an
hour to free her. Took her straight into surgery when we got her back. She was
unconscious and she'd lost a lot of blood. She's lost her leg I'm afraid."
Betty gasped and looked down at the floor.
"I'm sorry miss, we have to go. We're still on our shift. We'll check in a 
little later", said Jack getting up again and looking towards Farookh.
"Anne's pretty strong,she'll be fine", said Farookh, knowing that she was not
going to be fine at all. The slowly made their exit.

Betty continued to sip her coffee and looked for movement now and again. Betty 
was the older sister by two years. She worked as an investment banker for Wells
Fargo and most of her colleauges were in a state of shock. There was no pressure
on her to be at work. She thought about Steve her fiancee and the upcoming 
wedding. Would Anne make it? She hoped so. Betty was wearing her business suit
even though she wasn't going to work that day. But it gave her a sense of 
routine and familiarity. She was a little taller than Anne but only a little.
Her hair longer and usually tied back. She liked to run too but she didn't lift
weights like Anne. They used to race each other when they were younger but now
they would compete in a tough way that wasn't pleasant to either of them. They
were both busy people and rarely caught up with each other aside from family
events. They got on OK but they weren't as close as they were in their teens.
After Betty went off to college Anne got a whole new circle of friends and they
moved further and further apart.

Betty looked at her watch. It was midday and she could hear footsteps approaching
the room. There was faint knock before her parents entered accompanied by the 
nurse. They took of their jackets and sat down. The nurse took a look at her 
chart and then checked the drip. She also adjusted the dials on one of the 
machines. Then she turned and smiled.
"The doctor will be with you shortly", said the nurse and left the room.
Betty's mother looked at Anne and then at Betty. She began to weep quietly and
her father comforted her by drawing her close. Betty reached out and held her
father's hand. None of them spoke but tried to comfort each other. Another 
victim and this time it was their family. It was a moment to take things on 
board and accept that this really was happening not only to them but to their
fellow New Yorkers. They were war casualties suffering from physical and from
emotional wounds. Betty's mother was crying not only for Anne but for all that
had happened and for all of those who were suffering right now. She was crying 
on behalf of Betty and her father who sat silently drinking in the grief.

A short while later when they had gradually returned from their collective
greiving her mother wiped her eyes and looked at her husband and her daughter.
Then she looked at Anne again lying on the bed. Her other baby who had been
doing so well. There was a groan from the bed and a subtle head movement. Betty
got up and went to the bedside. Anne opened her eyes and saw Betty peering at
her. She smiled and tried to move her hand to reach Betty. She groaned again 
and her smile turned back into a frown. Betty found Anne's right hand under
the sheets and clutched it. She recriprocated with a mild grip that was only
a shadow of her usual strong grip.
"Hey", said Betty with a slight tremble.
"Hey", mouthed Anne with the faintest sound. She shook her head slightly, the
best that she could manage as she looked Betty straight in the eyes.
Betty sat down again and let her mother have a turn. She stroked Anne's hair
and tried to stop her tears but she couldn't. 
"Oh my baby", said her mother as she continued to stroke her head.
Anne tried to mouth something but only a faint groan emerged. What had 
happened to her voice? She coughed and breathed heavily. 
A sharp knock was heard at the door which brought them all to attention. They
changed from a family mode into visitor mode. After waiting for a brief moment
the doctor entered.
"Hello, I'm doctor Jeffries. I'm sorry about the total chaos here but it's the
best that we can offer under these current circumstances."
When the introductions were over the doctor picked up Anne's chart but only as
a formality to create a pause for attention before starting to relate the 
details about Anne's state of health. Doctor Jeffries was also known as the
Angel of Death by his hospital colleagues. They had a twisted sense of humour
which they claimed was a way to help distance themselves from the realities
that they had to face each day. Doctor Jeffries was usually called in when bad
news had to be broken. Anne looked up and recognised him. No further 
explanations were required. She knew it was bad. But how bad?
"I'll cut to the chase as we don't have much time and as you can appeciate we
are very busy here at the moment. We've amputated the lower part of Anne's
left leg mainly due to the amount of fracturing and blood loss. She has also
suffered internal injuries the extent of which should be apparent to us when
we have the results of all the tests. She's had blood transfusion to cover the
losses the incurred after her accident. And she's breathed in a lot of that 
dust. She's heavily sedated but stable and I'm surprised that she's woken up.
I guess that's a good sign. She's pretty strong and she's a fighter but she's
been hit hard this time. We're doing all we can to help her recover."
"What are you saying doctor? Is she going to be OK?", asked her mother.
"It's hard for me to say at this point until we've got the results of those
tests. But from what I've seen so far, I'm afraid it doesn't look good."
Anne heard the doctors words and passed back into unconsciousness. The doctor
adjusted the dials and then turned back to the family.
"I'll have a more concrete answer for by this evening but for the moment all
we have is hope. I'm real sorry to have to bring you this news. She's part of
my family too in a way." The doctor paused again.
"I'd better get back to my other patients. Just hang in there till tonight.
I'll call you when I have more news. You're welcome to stay as long as you 
like." He shook her fathers hand and quickly left the room.
Anne was out again and there wasn't much that they could do there. It was time
to go home. Betty decided to go with them.

When the phonecall finally came in the evening the news was worse. Some of her
internal organs had been infected and the initial transfusion hadn't been quite
enough to flush out the bad blood. Their intention was only to replace what had
been lost but the sepsis had already started. Anne had slipped into a coma and
was now on life support. The family rushed to the hospital as quickly as they
could this time joined by Steve, Betty's fiancee. She wanted him close her as
he was soon to become part of the family. It comforted him that he was allowed
to comfort her in this way.

They arrived at the room to find Jack and Farookh inside. They nooded in 
greeting and politely left the room. This was family time now. The doctor 
followed them inside. The sound of the EEG machine bleeping at a regular 
rhythm acted as a backdrop to their staccato conversation.
"I'm sorry to have to give you even more bad news", said doctor Jeffries,"she
went into a coma mid-afternoon and we've noticed a lot of toxins in her blood.
I'd be surprised if she survives the night. The heartbeat is slow and weak and
the blood is only pushing the poisons around the body. She could go at any 
moment now. I'll leave you with her. I'm so sorry." He pursed his lips, nodded
gravely and made a very slight bow before leaving the room.

They held hands and struggled to accept the reality of the situation. They'd 
had enough to deal with already. The only thing left was hope but the doctor
had taken that away. Anne was going to die and she was going to die very soon.
Nothing could be done about it not even by the magicians in the white coats. A 
more powerful magic was at hand and it was about take away Anne's life. It 
would have been the same if there had been an abductor pointing a gun at her
head or if she was standing at the top of a tall building ready to jump. All
they could do was look on and wait for the inevitable to happen.

It wasn't a long wait. Just over 40 minutes later the intermittent bleep of the
EEG changed to constant. Anne's mother fell upon her body heaving deep sobs. 
The father with tears in eyes got up to comfort the mother. And the sister 
turned to her fiancee. A few moments later the doctor and nurse walked in. She
turned off the EEG machine. The doctor checked for a pulse but found none. The
father coaxed the mother away from her dead baby and took her in his arms. The
started to disconnect the machines and unhook the tubes.
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry", said the doctor. "I'll give you a minute to say 
your goodbyes but I'm afraid we are desperate for space so we'll need to clear
out this room as soon as we can. I'll be in my office".
The doctor was pretty cut up himself. One of his own had died. He wasn't 
normally so involved with his patients but this time it was different. Soon he
would have to turn his attention again to the many victims still coming into
the hospital.

After a few short words with the doctor the family quietly left the hospital
while more and more people continued to enter. They went back to Betty's 
parents house just to be together for a while. Even though they'd been together
for a while Steve was still feeling like an outsider but Betty held on to him
tightly. She needed him now. Time to put all his doubts to one side.
