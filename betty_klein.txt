10.00 am on Wednesday September 12th 2001. Anne placed a face mask over another
unknown victim of the attacks. They were all covered in the grey dust that 
permeated the atmosphere. This one was was a survivor but barely conscious. She
and her colleague Jack heaved the stretcher up the the two steps into the 
ambulance and closed the doors. Jack slapped hard on the panel and shouted,
"Let's go".
The driver put the vehicle into drive and they sped up to slow cruise. With dust
and debris on the road and grey snow falling they couldn't drive at their normal
speed.
"Pulse is weak on this one", said Anne, "should we give her a shot?"
"I don't know, she may go into shock if she wakes up", said Jack, "we don't have
far to go".
They soon arrived at St. Vincents and heaved the new patient out of the vehicle.
They put the stretcher onto a gurney and the hospital staff took over. 
"I need the bathroom, be right back. Don't leave without me", said Jack trying
to put some humour into it.
Anne and the driver Farookh both tutted but also realised what he was trying to
do. Anne lit a cigarette. She blew out hard after her first puff. Farookh got 
back into the drivers seat and waited with the engine idling. About halfway
through her cigarette Anne felt her hand shaking and held it steady with her
other hand. She looked around quickly to see if anyone had noticed that she had
done that. But they were all too busy. Their job was to think about others and
not to worry about themselves and that was what they did. She took one more puff
and saw Jack rushing back with a fast walk.
"Did you wash your hands?", asked Anne.
"No, we don't have time for hygeine", answered Jack.
"Men!", said Anne, "you're all such pigs". She checked her medi kit and nodded.
"All set?", asked Jack, "OK, let's hit it".
As soon as they had closed the door the ambulance was reversing back out onto the
main street and then back into the grey snow and the trade center buildings. This
time the visibility was better and they drove a little faster. They were wearing
dust masks and preparing themselves for more bodies.
"About as close as we can get", shouted Farookh leaning back and turning his head
to the right. He waited while Jack and Anne got out and found their way through 
the rubble to where the firemen were working. They were squinting and waving away
the air directly in front of them whilst carrying their medi bags in other hands.
"You got any more for us?", asked Jack. 
"Some more live ones that way", the fireman pointed them in the direction of 
another group of firemen a few feet away.
The whole place had a sort of eerie silence and was yet so loud. A sound that 
couldn't be avoided. But one they had to shut out in order to do their job. Anne
coughed.
"When are you going to quit smoking?", said Jack, "you know those things'll kill
you."
"Thanks for the warning Mr. Surgeon General", she said just after recovering from
her cough."Be sure to attend my funeral", she said again with a Southern drawl.
When they had navigated their way through the rubble and big chuncks of concrete
they spoke to the group of firemen.
"Got any live ones?", asked Jack hopefully.
"I think they're gone", replied the fireman pointing down to a group of four 
bodies they had unearthed. "You best check them to make sure".
Three middle aged women and one man all covered in dust and wearing business 
clothes. Anne and Jack nodded gravely and took out their stethoscopes. Anne 
checked the two women closest to her. Nothing. No pulse or heartbeat. Shit. Jack
checked the other two. The man was gone but the woman had a faint heartbeat. 
"This one is still beating but only just", said Jack,"Let's get the stretcher".
They walked back to the ambulance to fetch the stretcher.
"You find any more survivors?", asked Farookh.
"Yeah, we got one. Be right back." Anne didn't want to mention the dead ones.
They loaded the womans body onto the stretcher and carried her back to the 
ambulance.
"This one's a bit lighter than that last one", said Jack.
"Yeah, quite a lot."
With the patient loaded Jack rapped on the ambulance wall again to signal them
to go. Farookh turned on the siren and they were heading back up 8th Avenue to
St. Vincents. The hospital was filling up fast and they were having to discharge
as many as they could in order to free up beds. But they didn't need one for 
this latest patient. The faint heartbeat got fainter and fainter till it was 
gone. They arrived with a corpse.
"Shit", said Anne and threw the swab she was using to wipe the dust from the
patients face. She turned away to face the inside wall of the ambulance and 
breathed hard a mixture of anger and sadness. She could feel it welling up but
felt it pass away as she breathed again.
Jack breathed out long and slow. A worried and confused look on his face. They
just had to go on. 
Farookh got out of the vehicle and streched his back. The others got out of the
back and caught his eye and shook their heads. His shoulders hunched. Another
moment of defeat but he knew there were more survivors to be found and wasn't
giving up just yet.
"This one died on the way", said Jack as he handed the body over to the staff
at the hospital."Should we bring the other bodies?"
"It's a tough call but we need stay focused on the live ones", said the doctor.

Anne and her crew had been on the early shift and were starting to get tired
but wouldn't admit that to themselves. They were alive and healthy while there
were others trapped below the debris. It was a mixture of guilt, compassion and
a sense of duty that kept them going back into the zone of the crumbled 
buildings to see if more bodies could be found. But it made no sense to kill
themselves in the process. Everyone was doing their bit but they were in the 
priveliged position of being paramedics and actually being able to help when 
they found someone.
"Should we stop for lunch?", said Farookh,"I'm getting a bit dizzy at the wheel"
He was the first to break the compassionate resolve and someone had. You have to
make sure that your own mask is securely fitted before trying to help anyone
else. The reality began to sink in but Anne suggested that they do one more
trip before stopping for a late lunch. She didn't want to break the flow now
that they were on a roll. They pulled the dust masks over their nose and mouth
as they approached the grey snow and rubble once again. A group of firemen saw
them and were signalling to them before they had even stopped. Farookh leaned
back and shouted to Jack and Anne.
"Looks like they got something. They're waving me to come closer"
They opened the door and jumped out as soon as the van had stopped and walked 
quickly toward the fireman who was beckoning them.
"We found a way into a room and there about ten people in there. Mostly concust
I think but all alive. Some are conscious. You'd better get in there".
Both Jack and Anne were relieved to hear this news.
"We need to get them out fast though as it's gonna come down pretty soon. We've
put some supports in to hold it up but we're not sure how long they'll hold."
They went in to see how many there were and what needed to be done. Jack got on
his radio and told Farookh to contact the hospital for more help and to come and
help carry bodies. There were four that were conscious and could walk. They were
pretty bruised and one had a broken arm. They could help. The second ambulance
arrived and took three bodies. They were in good shape and were only concust.
The other three had bigger breaks from falling debris but were still alive but
out cold. Once all ten had been removed from the room Anne was the last one out
and that was when the whole thing gave way. If she had left only a few seconds
earlier then things would have been very different. But the falling debris had
caught her. Her left leg was pinned down by a great big piece of concrete and
she couldn't move. Already tired and running on adrenaline she passed out very
soon. The firemen rushed off to find crowbars and tried their damndest to move
the block just enough to free the leg but it just wouldn't budge. After about
an hour of trying and more helpers they managed to shift it enough to free her
leg. It was broken and bleeding and covered in the grey dust. Farookh and Jack
who had remained on the scene took her back to the hospital while the last 
drops of adrenline kept them going.
"Oh shit", said the doctor when they arrived at the hospital and looked away
for a moment."How's she doing?"
"Not great doc. Three major fractures and lost a lot of blood. She's also 
inhaled a lot of dust. But she's alive."
"Take her straight in", said the doctor, "and you two are officially on your
break, you hear me!"
They didn't wait to see the doctor kick the door and swear. He knew that the
crews were pushing it hard and they had to but they needed to rest too or they
were no good to anyone.
They felt the guilt and they also felt they should get out there again but they
stayed with their team mate. She was straight into surgery and they waited 
outside. As soon as they sat down the tiredness took over and their their heads
started to nod. 
Three hours later the surgeon popped out and removed his gloves. He undid his 
facemask and then spoke.
"We got some blood into her but had to lose the leg below the knee. Way too much
damage." He shook his head. "We x-rayed the lungs and there's a lot 'o dust in
there. And it just doesn't look good". These were paramedics he was talking to
so he wasn't going to bullshit them with possible positive prognoses. 
"Girl was smokin' 40 a day: guess that doesn't help much", said Jack.
The surgeon shook his head again. "I don't know if she'll make it", he said,
"but she's stable and should be awake in the morning. Fucking towel headed 
fucks." He looked at Farookh, "No offence".
Farookh looked away as the surgeon walked back into the operating room.
Both Jack and Farookh headed over to the cafeteria to get a long overdue meal.
Neither spoke and joined the line with their tray. The place was quite full but
had a dismal feel. It wreaked of despair and hopelessness. They breathed it in.

*********************************************************************************

On the morning of Thursday the 13th of September 2011 at around 11.00 am Anne
began to stir and it took her a few moments to realise where she was. The walls
and decor were familiar to her but where had she seen them before? Home? No it
wasn't home. A friend's house? No, not there either. So it was work. She turned
hear head and immediately felt the oxygen mask on top of her face and then also
noticed that she was finding it difficult to breathe. She wanted a cigarette 
but that wasn't going to happen. She tried to turn her head further to see if 
there might be a pack on the nightstand but it was too painful. She tried to move
her left arm and felt the needle of the drip in there before she noticed the 
drip itself. She watched it for a moment seeing the drop growing in size till 
it got big enough to fall and trickle down. Next to this she saw something that
was hanging from the ceiling. Her eyes followed it down and she noticed and felt
it at the same time: her left leg. She tried to move it but felt very little
sensation. Her heart beat a little faster and she breathed harder. A minor 
sense of panic set in as she looked around at everything once more. She was so
used to being the one taking people to hospital that it very strange to her
to be the one now lying in the bed. With a great sense of disbelief and shock
she began to slowly take the situation on board. She was hurt, badly hurt and
she was in a hospital bed. The decor told that it was St. Vincents. Then the
scene came back to her. Feeling tired and running on adrenaline. Moving those
people out of that room and into the ambulance. She was the last one out of
there but she didn't make it. The ceiling had collapsed and trapped her there.
She didn't remember anything else. She breathed hard again and felt her eyes
closing. 

Anne had been a paramedic since her early twenties. She loved being on the scene
and being able to help right when the help was needed. She was almost 33 now 
and was very dedicated to her job. Having no husband or children she always took
the difficult shifts that the others didn't want or couldn't do. She was one of
those people who was married to her job. She was short at five feet nothing but
slim and very fit. When she wasn't working she spent her time looking after her
own fitness. She liked to run and lift weights at the gym. This wasn't in order
to have a beautiful body but to be fit for the job. She needed stamina to keep
her going when things got tough and she needed strength to lift bodies. But 
she didn't diet like most other women and she smoked and drank. She knew that
these were detrimental to her health but somewhere in her mind she figured that
if she was doing good it would cancel out the harm that she was doing to herself
by smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. The risk of going to accident sites
was much higher than the slower internal damage. Her nails were cut short but
she didn't bite them. Her hair was short too. Strawberry blond going on red 
with a grown out fringe that she blew occassionally and brushed aside with the
back of her hand.

Jack and Farookh had contacted Anne's family and told them of her condition. 
Her sister Betty had been there since early morning and her parents were due
to arrive quite soon. Betty finished her cigarette and got another coffee from
the machine before returning to Anne's room. As she turned the handle and took
another sip from her cup she noticed two paramedics sitting in the room next
to the bed. She was immediately taken aback and wondered if the situation had
got worse. 
"Oh god, is everything OK?", she asked in a mildly panicked voice.
"You must be Betty", answered Jack getting up and offering his hand,"I'm Jack
and this in Farookh. We were on Anne's crew yesterday. I believe I spoke to 
you on the phone".
"Oh hi. Pleased to meet you. Thanks for calling", she said with a slight gulp
"I sometimes forget she's a paramedic too", Betty was shaking a little and
sat down.
"The nurse told me a little", said Betty,"but not many details. Can you guys
fill me in?"
"We can tell you what happened yesterday. The three of us were pretty tired but
we knew there were more bodies. So we went back. The fire crews had excavated
a room with ten people. Some were alive and moving so we got them all out. Anne
was the last to leave when the ceiling collapsed and she got trapped under the
rubble."
"Her leg was under a big block of concrete", continued Jack,"and it took us an
hour to free her. Took her straight into surgery when we got her back. She was
unconscious and she'd lost a lot of blood. She's lost her leg I'm afraid."
Betty gasped and looked down at the floor.
"I'm sorry miss, we have to go. We're still on our shift. We'll check in a 
little later", said Jack getting up again and looking towards Farookh.
"Anne's pretty strong,she'll be fine", said Farookh, knowing that she was not
going to be fine at all. The slowly made their exit.

Betty continued to sip her coffee and looked for movement now and again. Betty 
was the older sister by two years. She worked as an investment banker for Wells
Fargo and most of her colleauges were in a state of shock. There was no pressure
on her to be at work. She thought about Steve her fiancee and the upcoming 
wedding. Would Anne make it? She hoped so. Betty was wearing her business suit
even though she wasn't going to work that day. But it gave her a sense of 
routine and familiarity. She was a little taller than Anne but only a little.
Her hair longer and usually tied back. She liked to run too but she didn't lift
weights like Anne. They used to race each other when they were younger but now
they would compete in a tough way that wasn't pleasant to either of them. They
were both busy people and rarely caught up with each other aside from family
events. They got on OK but they weren't as close as they were in their teens.
After Betty went off to college Anne got a whole new circle of friends and they
moved further and further apart.

Betty looked at her watch. It was midday and she could hear footsteps approaching
the room. There was faint knock before her parents entered accompanied by the 
nurse. They took of their jackets and sat down. The nurse took a look at her 
chart and then checked the drip. She also adjusted the dials on one of the 
machines. Then she turned and smiled.
"The doctor will be with you shortly", said the nurse and left the room.
Betty's mother looked at Anne and then at Betty. She began to weep quietly and
her father comforted her by drawing her close. Betty reached out and held her
father's hand. None of them spoke but tried to comfort each other. Another 
victim and this time it was their family. It was a moment to take things on 
board and accept that this really was happening not only to them but to their
fellow New Yorkers. They were war casualties suffering from physical and from
emotional wounds. Betty's mother was crying not only for Anne but for all that
had happened and for all of those who were suffering right now. She was crying 
on behalf of Betty and her father who sat silently drinking in the grief.

A short while later when they had gradually returned from their collective
greiving her mother wiped her eyes and looked at her husband and her daughter.
Then she looked at Anne again lying on the bed. Her other baby who had been
doing so well. There was a groan from the bed and a subtle head movement. Betty
got up and went to the bedside. Anne opened her eyes and saw Betty peering at
her. She smiled and tried to move her hand to reach Betty. She groaned again 
and her smile turned back into a frown. Betty found Anne's right hand under
the sheets and clutched it. She recriprocated with a mild grip that was only
a shadow of her usual strong grip.
"Hey", said Betty with a slight tremble.
"Hey", mouthed Anne with the faintest sound. She shook her head slightly, the
best that she could manage as she looked Betty straight in the eyes.
Betty sat down again and let her mother have a turn. She stroked Anne's hair
and tried to stop her tears but she couldn't. 
"Oh my baby", said her mother as she continued to stroke her head.
Anne tried to mouth something but only a faint groan emerged. What had 
happened to her voice? She coughed and breathed heavily. 
A sharp knock was heard at the door which brought them all to attention. They
changed from a family mode into visitor mode. After waiting for a brief moment
the doctor entered.
"Hello, I'm doctor Jeffries. I'm sorry about the total chaos here but it's the
best that we can offer under these current circumstances."
When the introductions were over the doctor picked up Anne's chart but only as
a formality to create a pause for attention before starting to relate the 
details about Anne's state of health. Doctor Jeffries was also known as the
Angel of Death by his hospital colleagues. They had a twisted sense of humour
which they claimed was a way to help distance themselves from the realities
that they had to face each day. Doctor Jeffries was usually called in when bad
news had to be broken. Anne looked up and recognised him. No further 
explanations were required. She knew it was bad. But how bad?
"I'll cut to the chase as we don't have much time and as you can appeciate we
are very busy here at the moment. We've amputated the lower part of Anne's
left leg mainly due to the amount of fracturing and blood loss. She has also
suffered internal injuries the extent of which should be apparent to us when
we have the results of all the tests. She's had blood transfusion to cover the
losses the incurred after her accident. And she's breathed in a lot of that 
dust. She's heavily sedated but stable and I'm surprised that she's woken up.
I guess that's a good sign. She's pretty strong and she's a fighter but she's
been hit hard this time. We're doing all we can to help her recover."
"What are you saying doctor? Is she going to be OK?", asked her mother.
"It's hard for me to say at this point until we've got the results of those
tests. But from what I've seen so far, I'm afraid it doesn't look good."
Anne heard the doctors words and passed back into unconsciousness. The doctor
adjusted the dials and then turned back to the family.
"I'll have a more concrete answer for by this evening but for the moment all
we have is hope. I'm real sorry to have to bring you this news. She's part of
my family too in a way." The doctor paused again.
"I'd better get back to my other patients. Just hang in there till tonight.
I'll call you when I have more news. You're welcome to stay as long as you 
like." He shook her fathers hand and quickly left the room.
Anne was out again and there wasn't much that they could do there. It was time
to go home. Betty decided to go with them.

When the phonecall finally came in the evening the news was worse. Some of her
internal organs had been infected and the initial transfusion hadn't been quite
enough to flush out the bad blood. Their intention was only to replace what had
been lost but the sepsis had already started. Anne had slipped into a coma and
was now on life support. The family rushed to the hospital as quickly as they
could this time joined by Steve, Betty's fiancee. She wanted him close her as
he was soon to become part of the family. It comforted him that he was allowed
to comfort her in this way.

They arrived at the room to find Jack and Farookh inside. They nooded in 
greeting and politely left the room. This was family time now. The doctor 
followed them inside. The sound of the EEG machine bleeping at a regular 
rhythm acted as a backdrop to their staccato conversation.
"I'm sorry to have to give you even more bad news", said doctor Jeffries,"she
went into a coma mid-afternoon and we've noticed a lot of toxins in her blood.
I'd be surprised if she survives the night. The heartbeat is slow and weak and
the blood is only pushing the poisons around the body. She could go at any 
moment now. I'll leave you with her. I'm so sorry." He pursed his lips, nodded
gravely and made a very slight bow before leaving the room.

They held hands and struggled to accept the reality of the situation. They'd 
had enough to deal with already. The only thing left was hope but the doctor
had taken that away. Anne was going to die and she was going to die very soon.
Nothing could be done about it not even by the magicians in the white coats. A 
more powerful magic was at hand and it was about take away Anne's life. It 
would have been the same if there had been an abductor pointing a gun at her
head or if she was standing at the top of a tall building ready to jump. All
they could do was look on and wait for the inevitable to happen.

It wasn't a long wait. Just over 40 minutes later the intermittent bleep of the
EEG changed to constant. Anne's mother fell upon her body heaving deep sobs. 
The father with tears in eyes got up to comfort the mother. And the sister 
turned to her fiancee. A few moments later the doctor and nurse walked in. She
turned off the EEG machine. The doctor checked for a pulse but found none. The
father coaxed the mother away from her dead baby and took her in his arms. The
started to disconnect the machines and unhook the tubes.
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry", said the doctor. "I'll give you a minute to say 
your goodbyes but I'm afraid we are desperate for space so we'll need to clear
out this room as soon as we can. I'll be in my office".
The doctor was pretty cut up himself. One of his own had died. He wasn't 
normally so involved with his patients but this time it was different. Soon he
would have to turn his attention again to the many victims still coming into
the hospital.

After a few short words with the doctor the family quietly left the hospital
while more and more people continued to enter. They went back to Betty's 
parents house just to be together for a while. Even though they'd been together
for a while Steve was still feeling like an outsider but Betty held on to him
tightly. She needed him now. Time to put all his doubts to one side.
********************************************************************************
Just three days after anne died the funeral procession drove to the outskirts of 
the city. It was surprising how many had gathered at such short notice and 
during such difficult times. It was a traditional open casket service. The 
service proceeded quickly and the short speeches that were made were handled
sensitively. There was some laughter amongst the tears telling how Anne would 
often lead the way when others hesitated. Her hospital colleages made some of
the most moving eulogies. 

After the burial the parties all filed out of the cemetary, back into town to
attend the wake at a bar near Betty's parents house. They figured that those 
that weren't close family could attend the bar and then later on those that were
closer could continue on to the parents house. Only a few stayed on for their 
2nd drink. Not that they didn't want to pay their respects to Anne, they'd 
already done that by attending, but that they didn't really want to be around.
It was understandable I guess when you consider that the others were fairly 
heavy drinkers and if you wanted to be around them then you would need to be
a heavy drinker yourself. Betty and her fiancee were planning on getting drunk.
But that tended to be their plan most of the time. They had a little smoke now
and then but mainly it was alcohol. Jack and Farookh stayed on as well as some
of Anne's colleagues from the hospital.

The venue was Miller's Bar on 17th St. It was about four blocks from Betty's
parents, so not far at all when it was time to go to the after party. A lot of
the older folks had already gone home and Betty's parents remained mainly out
of politeness and due to the fact that they would be hosting the next thing.
But they were starting to get tired and around 11.00 decided to call it a 
night and said goodbye to everyone. They told everyone remaining that their 
house was available from then onwards for more drinks, snacks and conversation.
They waved as they left the bar and from those that waved back it was clear to
see how many remained. Steve's brother Eric had always had a crush on Anne but
never really did anything about it. Everyone knew about it and brought it up
sometimes. It had hit him hard. He'd thought that he would have all the time
in the world to find a way into her heart but now this. A few minutes later
he came out of the toilets wiping his mouth and looking very spent. He walked
straight up to Steve.
"I think I'm done guys", he said, looking first at Steve then at Betty, "I 
don't think I can handle much more. Probably need to sleep it off".
Steve stood up and give him a hug. They slapped each other on the back. Eric
give him a tight lipped smile and zipped up his jacket before heading towards
the door. He didn't wave to the others and just went straight out.
"Pretty cut up huh", said Bettty as Steve sat down again. "He always thought
that he was in with a chance. She liked him. She really did but she was 
married to the job. We all knew that".
"You got that right", said Farookh having overheard from the next table.
Aside from Betty, Steve, Jack and Farookh only one other person now remained
following Eric's departure and that was Helen. She was another paramedic who
worked with her on occassion. She was as dedicated as Anne and they just 
admired each other a great deal. They were great friends but didn't really
hang out much outside of their work life. I guess they didn't need to given the
amount of time that they spent together. The three of them found it strange to
out drinking together even though they spent time together like this many times
but never out of their uniforms and outside of the job. But this was a strange
situation but the company was familiar. Their minds seemed to flicker between
feeling comfortable and familiar to feeling that something was wrong and weird.
But they were also used to being thrown into crises and having to deal with it
fast and put their own concerns to one side. This was another kind of crisis 
which didn't involve any particular procedures or reaching for their medical
kits.

Both parties realised that they were the only remaining people so drew closer
to each other. Everyone was drinking from small glasses so it was clear that
it was hard liqueur all round. Betty addressed the whole group.
"How about one more drink and then we head over to my parents place? Whisky
or Tequila?" There was no option of no drink.
Everyone agreed to whisky as tequila was more about going out and partying and
this was a more sombre occassion. Betty brought the five small shot glasses 
from the bar herself without so much as a wobble. She dealt them out to each
person sitting and then raised her glass aloft.
"To Anne. To her courage and dedication." Betty made the toast.
They each raised their glasses and looked at each other without clinking. For 
a moment Betty felt a tremble pass through her and then everyone drank their
shot. The characteristic grimace followed the shot a second before the sound
of the glass being slammed on the table. 
"Shall we?", invited Betty.
They all stood up and got their coats. They all thanked the staff and waved 
before exiting the bar and heading toward nearest cab. Betty spoke again.
"Steve and I are going to walk as it's not far. It's four blocks or so and we
could do with a little air. If you guys want to take a cab I'll give you the
address. The others decided to walk too and made a group of three that was
following Betty and Steve closely behind. Betty lit a cigarette and put her
left arm through Steve's right. They smiled at each other but didn't really
say much. The three behind them just shuffled along. Farookh thought it was
rude as a guest to turn up empty handed so they stopped at an off licence
and bought a bottle of Jack Daniels. Betty and Steve waited outside while
they made their purchase. There was no need but they felt a sort of social
obligation to do so. Betty shrugged and didn't try and deter them.

When they arrived at the apartment building Betty showed them in and they took
the lift up to the third floor. It wasn't a massive apartment but you could 
see that it was big enough to have been a family home. As soon as Betty 
entered she could no longer hold back the tears. She found her mother after
the first sob. They clung to each other as they let the deeper low belly sobs
come out. They were a close family and they were quite open with each other at
least with feelings like these ones. This was not a time to be proud and stoical.
Betty's father ushered the others inside and took their coats. He offered them 
a place to sit and offered them food and drinks. Betty and her mother pulled 
apart and they started to put dishes of snacks onto the table, snacks that her
mother had prepared for the occassion. She could have bought them but it was a
way for her to focus on something practical and distract herself from what she
was feeling. 
"You OK Betty", asked Steve. Betty nodded while the others looked on without
turning fully.
"Be right back", she said. After going to the toilet she opened the door to 
Anne's old room and turned on the light. There was boxes in there now and also
things that were being stored but there were one or two things from when it was
still her room. She looked at the old pictures that Anne had put there but she
didn't want to linger too long with all the guests there. She turned off the 
light and closed the door.
Jack grabbed a handful of nuts and emptied them into his mouth as Betty came
back into the room. Steve pushed a chair out for her and she sat down and 
joined them. There were five sitting at the table and two were standing. Betty's
mother was still being the mother and going back into the kitchen getting drinks
and clearing things away. Habit of a lifetime that couldn't be put to rest even
in this dark hour. It gave her comfort in some ways. Betty's father wished that
she would sit down and stop fussing but she wouldn't and couldn't. Betty had 
offered to help but her mother was just far to restless to sit quietly and chat.
Helen was the other person standing but not for the same reason. She was looking
around the room and stopping to look at the photos while sipping on a vodka. She
was still inspired by Anne and was interested to know where she came from. There
were photos from all ages of her life dotted about the place. Every now and then
she would ask about a photo or an ornament to which either Betty or her father
would answer. Betty then asked her father to recount a tale of when Anne was 
about nine years old and she had saved a girl at school. Her father was a tad
reluctant as he had been holding back a little himself but figured it was a good
way to let out his pride rather than his grief.
"Come on Dad, you remember it better than I do", encouraged Betty.
"All right", he said and another sip of his whisky before starting to tell the
tale. Betty's mother came back into the room drying a ceramic oven dish and 
Helen turned around from her inspection of photographs.
"Even back then she liked to run and this was a training run with cross country
team. She wasn't hugely competitive but she thought that if she was around 
comptetitive people it would motivate her and help her to improve her running.
It worked. It was a good strategy and it not only helped her running but her
schoolwork too". He swilled his whisky round his glass as he paused for thought
and everyone waited for the next word.
"It was mainly open fields and tracks but this route happened to go through a
small wooded area just to add a little variety. There was a girl who was not so
great and trailing the pack and she tripped in the wooded part. Got her foot 
caught on a tree root. Well, she was going as fast as she could to try and keep
pace so you can imagine that she fell heavily and hurt herself. She hit her 
head and was out cold. Anne had noticed that she was struggling and was looking
back to check on her and saw quite soon that she wasn't there. She told the 
person next to her that she was going back to check and of course found this 
girl out cold. We knew she'd been reading books on first aid and was working on
her sling tying when she was at home but we thought it was just a doctor and 
nurse playrole kind of thing but she knew what she was doing. She put this girl
into the recovery position and blew her whistle. The girl had cut her head a 
little and Anne wiped the area clean with some wet wipes that she had with her.
I mean I don't know how or why she had all this stuff but she did and you can't 
really carry much when you're running. She showed us the little medikit that
she had put together with everyday things when she got home. All in a tiny 
rucksack". He took another big sip of whisky and refilled his glass and another
one.
"The runners all came back to the spot and the fittest one took a group and ran
back to the starting point to get help. The adult supervising the session told
her that she'd done well and was very glad to have a responsible person on the 
team. Anne didn't really care about the praise but that her 'patient' would be
OK. They weren't too far from the city and an ambulance arrived within half an
hour or so. The girl survived but it was Anne's quick response and action that
saved her. The ambulance crew could see she had potential doing that kind of
work and that it wasn't just a fluke or passing phase. There was a real sense 
of maturity in a girl of such a young age. That was the start really."
Her father closed his eyes for a moment and they could all see his eyebrows
knit together. Betty's mother came close behind where her father was sitting
and telling the story. She put her hand on his shoulder and stroked gently. He
put up his hand touched the back of her hand. He took his glass and drank what
was left in it. He sighed. Betty's mother squeezed his shoulder gently and 
went back to the kitchen to continue with the drying. More smalltalk continued
and everyone had one more drink. Betty and Steve wanted to go home and the 
others decided that they wanted to go too. It was late and they had all had a 
little too much. 

*********************************************************************************
The day after Anne's funeral Betty and Steve are back in New York. It's a Sunday
and everything is fairly quiet apart from the continuing rescue efforts and 
people trying to make sense of their lives. For some the strategy is to try and
carry on as before; to go on living their lives, proud of who they were and to
remain undeterred. Both Betty and Steve advocated to this ethos being native
New Yorkers.

It was already around 11.00am and they were only just stirring. They hadn't had 
much of a late night but they had drank very heavily and saw some people they 
hadn't seen in a while. We tend to think that a funeral is for the dearly 
departed but they're gone, what do they know. Can they really complain about 
the music or the speeches or the amount of alcohol that was drunk? A funeral is
for the living ones to say goodbye. Betty knew that but now that it was someone
dear to her she was finding it hard to detatch herself from the whole thing as
she normally would. She needed it just as much as anyone else.

How was she to carry on without her little sister? Granted she didn't see much
of her but she knew that she was there and they did see each other on a regular
basis. Things would have to change. These were the trains of thought that ran
through Betty's brain as she was waking up that Sunday morning.

The moment she became aware of her body her cursive thoughts immediately 
drifted away. She had a headache, her eyes hurt and her stomach was getting 
ready to heave. Moving quickly but without any sudden movements she moved to
the toilet hoping not to wake Steve. She didn't like how he fussed about these
things. She closed the door to muffle the sound even further and then proceeded
to make four consecutive heaves taking a few breaths between each one. She was
waiting for a fifth one that didn't come. She rinsed her mouth and dried it 
before using the toilet in the usual fashion. As she sat there she could feel
her heart beating hard but feeling no better as she was expecting. Betty was
used to drinking and this was a regular occurrence but on this occasion she 
wasn't feeling the relief that followed a vomit. It was as if it felt worse.
In fact it did feel worse. There was also some pain around her left breast.
A glass of water from the kitchen while she walked clumsily and bleary eyed
back to the bedroom. She hadn't flushed the toilet to remain quiet. She smiled
to herself when she thought about the look on Steve's face when he would see
it. With this thought in mind she put down the glass on the nightstand and 
tucked herself back into bed. Steve hadn't moved and was snoring quietly.
She turned and took another sip of water before putting her head back on the
pillow and drifting back to sleep.

About an hour later Steve started to groan and heard some noise in the 
upstairs apartment. He was nauseous and felt a little pain in his stomach
but he wasn't on the point of vomiting like Betty. He was made of stronger
stuff or so he thought. He yawned and shrugged his shoulders hard while his
whole body trembled. With his eyes still half-closed he slid out of bed with
the familiarity of someone who completely trusts their home. He lifted the lid
of the toilet and his manly resolve almost broke. An ugly reminder of the night
before. Betty liked her practical jokes. He made an empty heave as he tried to
concentrate on aiming his stream of urine. He made sure to flush and put some 
bleach down too. The smell of the chlorine was almost like smelling salts and
had the effect of waking him somewhat. Made him think about that slogan that
went something like waking up and smelling the coffee. Which of course made
him think about coffee. He went straight to the kitchen and started to gather
together all the things required for making coffee. It was Sunday so no loss
of brownie points for getting up so late especially after a night like that
but he didn't want to miss the day altogether. He smelled the milk and it ok
but could have been fresher. Black coffee? No, he liked it with milk so it 
meant a trip downstairs. He could hear the rustle of the duvet and soon Betty
came out. 
"Morning", said Steve, "thanks for the lovely surprise".
Betty sniggered and put her hand to her mouth, still feeling a little delicate.
"I know you love surprises so I made it specially. Pretty good night uh?"
"Yeah. Good to see everyone", replied Steve slightly steering the conversation
in a more sombre direction.
Betty hadn't forgotten that it wasn't just another party and it wasn't a way of
celebrating that they were still around while her sister was gone. But those 
were the facts and she had to deal with the fact that her sister was gone. Only
one day to grieve at least officially. No official month of mourning but who
knew how long it would take till that feeling of deep shock would pass and live
would actually go on again.
Betty had been out of the kitchen window while she was thinking about these 
things and Steve had noticed it but hadn't mentioned it while he continued to
prepare the morning coffee.
"I'm going to go grab some milk from the store and maybe get the papers too. 
Don't really want to get dressed but I'd rather not go out in my pyjamas and
slippers. Won't be long. You want anything?", he asked.
"I was thinking about eggs but actually I'm not sure. Why don't you get some
anyways and maybe I'll have them later on. Actually, pastry. Yeah, pastry."
Steve got changed quickly and made a quick wave before closing the door. He 
wouldn't be long but it would be long enough for Betty to go to another world
and come back again. Her mind flashed through odd disjointed memories. Some of
them would last for a few moments while others would pass in an instant. She 
wrapped her dressing gown tighter around herself and went to sit on the sofa.
It was an open plan apartment and the kitchen was more of a kitchen area than
a room in it's own right. She wanted to look out of the front window so she
got up again and opened the curtains. The light was bright and hurt her eyes.
She could see Steve on the street below going into the store. She wondered
what else he might buy. She sat down again and crossed her legs and sat right
into the corner of the sofa. She now began to feel more than she thought. The
thoughts and images running through her mind were all still there but the 
emotions now came more fully into the foreground of her experience. A great 
wave of sadness washed over her and she could feel herself being saturated 
by it. Sort of comforting in a way as it was a feelling that one would expect
at such a time. Almost like a cold wind that chills you when you first leave
a warm house. But soon you get used to it and continue walking. You know it's
winter and that sooner or later you need to get out of the house. It's warm
inside but it's not real. The actual season and climate were out of doors
and you had to face it. If you were wearing the right clothes then it was fine.
Betty was wearing the right clothes and she could bear the cold wind of her
sadness. It was that particular season and until that winter ended and spring
arrived, she would feel that chill right through into her bones. She would go
inside to sleep and be with her man but only for part of the time. And as one
gets accustomed to the cold one sees the finer details like the patterns on 
the snowflake: a touch of regret, a hint of anger, confusion, jealousy but most
of all a question which asked her what now? Her sister was dead: what did that
mean? She was going to die too and all of her friends and her family. Yes, all
of them. Every one. There was nothing that she could do about it except to 
accept that it was going to happen. She only just seemed to notice that tears
had been running down her face while she was examining her feelings and letting
them wash over her. She wiped her eyes on her sleeve when she heard the key go
into the door and the sound of Steve returning.
"Guess what I got", said Steve in his best gameshow voice.
"Apple pie?" asked Betty, trying to get back into that playful state.
"I got bagels from the deli. I forgot they were open on Sundays. I got the 
papers and a few things for dinner in case we wanna stay home tonight."
Steve was trying to be organised, his way of dealing with stuff, when he didn't
want to feel the full force of the situation he was in. Be practical. But he
was feeling it all the same.
"So; coffee?" asked Steve, assumming the answer would be yes. 
"Yeah, get it on. I'm going to take a very quick shower. I think I'll have eggs
too. Starting to feel hungry now. Bagels were a great idea", Betty was out of
the door before Steve could reply.
It wasn't a quick shower at all and Betty put her face into the stream just like
they do in the movies. It was sort of comforting and not something that she ever
did but this was the kind of situation where they would do it. They usually held
it there for a while but she didn't. She let it pour onto her back and stood 
there with her eyes closed. It was warm and comforting. She didn't get dressed
but came back into the sitting room in her bath robe. 
"It's almost ready. Big table or small table?"
"Small table. I want to sit on the sofa".
"Good plan".
Coffee, orange juice, scrambled eggs on toast, bagels with smoked salmon with a
few pastries to boot. The best hangover cure was to eat and rest. Replenish and
rehydrate. The coffee table was between the sofa and the window which went all
the way from the floor to the ceiling and gave a great view of the street 
outside. They both got their feet up on the sofa and watched the steam rising 
from the coffee and the cars moving slowly on the street below. They reached 
for their cups and took a sip and continued to watch the world outside. It was
much better than watching television. 

Now that Steve was there the feelings and thoughts that had welled up in her
had all gone away. It was as though it was no longer a private space. But Steve
was her fiancee. He was her man. He was her confidante. Or that was what she 
had assummed. But it was becoming apparent to her that this was not the case.
He looked at her for a moment while she munched on a bagel and took a big sip of
coffee. She noticed and smiled. But it was almost like a strangers smile. He
noticed this too. He didn't want to force her but all he really wanted was that
she open up to him and let it all out. But all in her own time and only if that
was what was required. Practical.

As Betty continued to eat her brunch she still felt slightly nauseous and also 
a cramp in her left breast, like it was tight or bloated. She winced but didn't
want Steve to notice that she was suffering any pain. The coffee had woken her
up but there was still a slight headache. Time for some aspirin. Steve sensed 
that something was wrong. 
"You OK? You look a little peeky.", Steve was concerned but didn't want to pry.
"Think maybe I had a bit more that I thought I did", she chuckled trying to be
open with Steve but still hiding the truth she wondered if there was something
else going on other than the hangover. She was a regular drinker and she knew
her hangovers all too well. This experince was very unfamiliar.
"I'm gonna have another aspirin I think", she said walking towards the kitchen
to get some water. After she had swallowed the pills she wondered whether she
should take her experience seriously or just write it up as an anomaly.
"You wanna go see a movie", she asked trying to maintain and present an upbeat
frame of mind.
"Sure, why not. You got anything in mind?".
"Not really. Why don't we just go there and see what's on? I need a little 
entertainment but nothing too demanding", she smiled.
"Let me check the papers, there might be something on quite soon", said Steve.
While Steve got his nose into the papers Betty quietly walked back into the
bedroom and clutched her left breast and groaned as quietly as she could. It
was painful. She gently squeezed and the whole breast felt tight and a swollen.
She moved into the bathroom so as not to arouse any suspicion now that she had
managed to divert it. She turned around carefully to check that Steve hadn't 
followed her and gradually moved the robe to one side and reveal the breast in
the mirror. The area around the nipple and areola was markedly bigger on the 
left side but only if they were exposed. The swelling seemed to be mainly on
the inside. She stared at the reflection for a moment longer and then covered
herself up. Sex in the dark? No squeezing? Only from behind? She knew that 
Steve would make a big deal out of it and that was exactly what she didn't 
want. She felt a slight heave but nothing came up. Good thing too with all that
nice brunch inside her. The minor gagging had made her eyes water and she 
quickly dried them in case that revealed anything. She put the tissue into the
toilet and flushed it before returning to the living room. Steve was still 
perusing the movie listings.
"There's something on in an hour", he said without raising his head, "looks 
like something that we might both enjoy. What do you think? Is that too soon?"
"No, that sounds perfect", said Betty. The phone rang and Steve answered it.
It was Steve's brother Eric. Steve told him that they were going to the movies
and couldn't talk for long. He asked if he could tag along.
"How do you feel about Eric coming with us?", asked Steve.
"I'm OK with it, what about you?", Betty deflected it back to Steve. He wasn't
really OK with it and was hoping that Betty would make the decision for him as
he wanted to be alone with Betty. Betty on the other hand was looking for less
intimacy without making it clear that that was what she wanted. Steve sighed
before taking his hand off the mouthpiece and Betty wandered toward the bedroom.
"I'm gonna get myself ready", said Betty feeling the aspirins taking effect and
the pain receding. Steve told his brother that he could come along. He was very
alone right now and he needed the company.

A few minutes later Betty was ready and they got a cab to the cinema. They met
Eric who was already there waiting for them. He had bought the tickets and he
insisted on paying for the snacks too. Betty and Steve weren't too hungry after
their brunch but cinema demanded popcorn so they got the smallest size which was
still quite large. Eric felt guilty about imposing upon them and was doing all
he could to make it up to them. They went to see Captain Corelli's Mandolin. It
was one that they all wanted to see and the only alternative at the time was
Jay and Silent Bob. Rock Star kind of appealed to Betty but that was on later.
As they made their way to their seats Betty smiled to herself that she had 
found the perfect solution for the evening. Being close to Steve without being
close to him at all. But she had to figure out why she wanted to do that. They
could all be together without spilling their guts and just be distracted for a
while. Even though they weren't too hungry they managed to eat most of the 
popcorn over the course of the film. The film had been running since the middle
of September and it was the middle of the afternoon on a Sunday so the theatre
was fairly quiet. There was hardly a queue at the end. They sat through all the
end credits as they had no pressing engagements only a hangover to recover from.
As they came into the foyer Eric did as expected and asked them if they would
like to stop for a coffee before returning home. It was just after 5.00pm and 
Betty didn't like the idea of going home just yet and being alone with Steve.
Better to stick with Eric and listen to his problems. They went to the diner 
across the road and again Eric insisted on paying. 

Having discussed the movie briefly Eric put another sugar cube into his coffee
and stirred it slowly before speaking. Both Betty and Steve were ready for it.
"I guess you guys knew that I was in love with Anne. I mean it common 
knowledge I suppose even though I didn't really talk about it much." Eric was
made his opening statements just to see if they would be happy to talk about
it a bit more. He expressed it in words just to be doubly sure before he
proceeded.
"Do you guys mind if I talk about this?", he asked.
They nodded and shrugged at the same time giving him the affirmation that he
needed. He continued.
"I mean I'm pretty sure that she knew too. That it was more than just a liking
or whatever." He paused. Took a sip of coffee with the spoon still in the cup.
"Would have been really neat and tidy you know, older brother with older sister
and younger brother with younger sister", he chuckled to try and make light of
something that was difficult to express.
"But now we'll never know". He made a long sigh.
"Shit, sorry guys. I don't want to bore you with this shit.", he was retreating.
He needed approval and prompting.
"Hey", said Betty, "it's OK. We all miss her and we all gotta deal with it. It
may be easier if you do talk about it. We're right here and we're listening."
Betty turned to Steve for his nod and he gave it. But Steve was doing it out of
guilt and brotherly love. He just wanted to get home and snuggle up with Betty
and enjoy the rest of his Sunday in a different way before the week at work 
started again. He put those feelings away; it was still early and there was 
still time. There was hope yet. He made an inner sigh. Eric continued once more.
"Well, thanks you guys, you don't know what that means. I really appreciate it".
"Did I tell you that we went on a date?", said Eric.
Betty and Steve looked at each other and looked back at Eric. Then shook their
heads looking puzzled. 
"It was quite recent so maybe she didn't tell you. Yeah, we went bowling and 
then had some dinner at that Italian place in Greenwich. And then we went back
to her place for coffee".
"Coffee?", said Betty pretending to look over her imaginary glasses.
"Hey, let me tell the story and then you'll see", said Eric.
"Yeah man, let's have all the details", said Steve with a slight wink.
"Steve!", exclaimed Betty, "let him finish the story". She winked back at him
without Eric noticing.
"Well, you know how busy she is, was. I just happened to call her on a day that
she was off work. Pretty lucky I guess. She had no plans and she agree to hang
out with me. I didn't present it as a date really. I picked her up at her place
and then we went to the bowling alley. She's good you know."
Betty nodded knowingly. "Always beats me".
"Well, after giving me a total thrashing she felt bad and said she'd take me 
for the best Italian food I'd ever had. I didn't feel too bad about getting 
beat by her. I mean just getting this chance to hang out with her was just so
awesome that was enough for me. But yeah, I couldn't tell her that. She knew I 
liked her but she just wasn't sure how much. So anyways, we changed our shoes
and headed over to this Italian place. It wasn't fancy, in fact it looked a bit
downbeat but the place was packed. Anne knew the waitress and we got a table 
straight away. She had already ordered before we sat down. I asked her why she
had done that and she said that looking through the menu would take far too 
long and she knew what she wanted and she had a pretty good idea of what I'd 
like too. A couple of bottles of beer arrived at the table a minute after we
sat down. Straight to the action was Anne. Paramedic all the way."
He removed the spoon from his coffee and swilled what was left around the cup.
He then drank it all in one gulp before continuing.
"I had this creamy seafood linguine and boy was she right. Best I'd ever had.
She had this tagliatelle with mushrooms. She fed me a mouthful and that was 
pretty good too. We just ate our food and got out of there. It wasn't really
a place to have a quiet tete a tete and there were more people waiting to get
inside. Anne suggested that we go to her place for coffee. She felt that she
still had to treat me. So that's how I ended up back her place for coffee."
Eric paused as though to say that was the end of the story but the other two
waited expectantly.
"OK, I'll tell you the next part. But really, there's nothing to tell", he
said looking dejected. He sighed slowly and continued once more.
"She makes great coffee you know," he said grinning looking down at his empty
cup. The others sniggered.
"So we sat on the couch, sipped our coffee and ate a couple of Hersheys. I mean
it was pretty laid back. You know like a friend, a real friend, where you can 
just go and hang out. She put on some music and she was talking about some 
concert that was coming up and whether she would have time to go or if she 
could take the time off, when I just moved across and tried to kiss her."
The others were motionless in eager anticipation, waiting for the next line to
be delivered. 
"She didn't pull away but she didn't kiss me back either. It was like she was
saying 'what the fuck' with her eyes. My lips landed on hers but her lips just
stayed the way they were and she waited for me to pull away. I kind of pulled
away slowly as it dawned on me that the spell had been broken. That all this 
time, throughout this date as I was calling it, I had thought she was feeling
exactly the same way and that the timing couldn't have been more perfect but 
how far I off the mark. Fuck. What a fucking dweeb. I just like crawled back 
into the corner of the couch like a little boy waiting for his punishment. I 
was looking around everywhere except at her kind of waiting for her to hit me
or something or shout at me. She kept her eyes looking straight forward and
didn't move for a minute. Then she slowly turned her head toward me and just 
gave me this totally confused look. Without saying a word she got up and left
the room. I got really scared at that point and thought that that was my cue to
leave. But she came back a minute later with the coffee pot in her hand. She
filled both our cups. She sat down again but facing me squarely and asked me to
tell her all about it. I just let it all out. Told her the whole thing. And then
felt pretty stupid as she sipped her coffee. She was very level headed about it
and told me that she liked me but not like in the way I did. Due to the nature
of her job and a previously failed relationship mainly due to her career she
only had very casual relationships. She thought that wouldn't be enough for me
and that it might be better if we didn't start anything. She was right but I 
would have been happy with a casual thing over nothing." 
He caught the waitress's eye and asked her over for a refill.
"Thing is that she was willing to give it a shot and if I got hurt as a result
of it then it would be my fault and not hers. Of course I nodded in agreement. 
Loved and lost and all that bullshit. We arranged a date. A real date this time
and it was going to be for the next time she was off. But with this whole 911
thing I didn't know if it would be happening anytime soon. Then she called to
say that her boss had told her to take a mandatory break because all the teams
were pushing themeselves so hard that needed to rest."
He sighed again and took a sip of coffee. Realised that he hadn't put any sugar
in it and stirred it in. He kept stirring for long time while the others were 
about to ask if he was OK when he looked up and a single tear rolled down the
side of his nose and his lips were quivering.
"That date was for today", he said using all the force he could muster not to
turn into a blubbering wreck. He put his face into his right palm and took a
couple of sharp breaths through his mouth.
Betty reached out and stroked the back of his head with her hand and then 
withdrew it to dry her own tears.
"Aw man, that really sucks. I'm sorry man."
He raised his head and nodded. Then made another long sigh through the mouth. 
He raised his coffee cup and made a toasting gesture. The others joined him.
"To Anne", he said and they all sipped.
"At least you got to tell her. I guess that's something", said Steve.
Eric didn't reply but nodded slightly and put more sugar into his coffee. 
"So, should we order? I'm getting a little hungry now. I don't want to put you
guys out if you wanna go home. Really, I don't mind. Stay if you want to stay
but don't stay on my account." He was giving them a clear opt out. Having heard
his story they decided to stay even though they both wanted some alone time.

After dinner they said goodbye to Eric and got a cab home. By helping Eric to
grieve they had moved forward in the process themselves. Now they could get 
back to each other. Back inside their apartment all they could feel was the
tiredness. It was dark and it was Sunday evening. Betty was on compassionate
leave but Steve had work the next morning. He was still feeling a slight 
distance from Betty and she wanted to keep herself from him but without him
knowing. There was only one place this could go and that was physical. With
his body close to hers he could feel that things were OK and that there was
closeness. With her body close to his she could feel that she was giving him
what he needed so he wouldn't feel that she was shutting him out. They were 
both rubbing their eyes, yawning and feeling as though they should just fall
into bed. But they smiled at each other. A smile that was half truth and half
veneer. They started undressing and kissing and stroking when Betty realised
that she didn't want Steve to see or touch her left breast. She had wondered
about this earlier in the day. She put a hand down to stroke his penis and 
continued to kiss him. She figured that would distract him while she was 
thinking ahead. She could feel his hand starting to touch her vagina and she
kissed him harder. They remained standing, kissing and stroking till Betty 
motioned toward the bed. Steve sat down on the side of the bed and Betty went
down on her knees on the floor so that she could put her mouth on his cock.
She sucked him tenderly but not for long. She knew he liked it but she also
knew that he couldn't handle much of it, like an old man with fried food. A 
minute or so later she stood up and turned around then slowly sat onto his
lap, sliding herself onto him. She could feel his hand take hold of the side
of her hips as she put her hands on the edge of the bed to help her move up
and down. She realises that he could at any moment grab her breasts so she 
leant forward and put her hands onto the floor. Steve wanted to continue the
motion but with Betty bent forward the stroke depth was shallow. He put his
right arm around her waist and pulled the both of them onto the bed. They 
both ended up on their left sides and Betty drew up her right knee to give 
him easier access. He thrusted a little harder and faster and then as she 
expected he cupped her right breast with his right hand. She put her own 
right hand on top of his and moved her hips in time with his thrusts to build
the rhythm and enjoy the full length. She could hear his groans and felt his
grip tightening. The thrusts were becoming more forceful and knew he was 
getting close. She wasn't quite as close as he was and reached down with her
right hand to speed things up a little. She accelerated till they were neck
and neck and both passed the finish line together. She felt him kissing the 
back of her neck and turned to give him her lips. She rubbed herself gently 
for a moment longer just to eek out the last remnants of the orgasm. He was
still inside her thrusting ever so gently still enjoying the sensations but
hampered by the post orgasmic hyper sensitivity. She could feel him getting
soft. Soon he'd be asleep.

Steve was snoring within minutes. It wasn't loud and it didn't disturb her
sleep but she found it comforting that she had managed to steer the events
in such a way. It was strange that she felt no guilt or remorse at hiding her
feelings from her fiancee. Was this a good basis for a marriage? Was this just
a passing phase? Perhaps she didn't want to admit it to herself and he was her
other half and telling him was tantamount to telling herself. She rubbed her
sticky hand on the side of her leg as she justified her reasoning for what she
had done. Soon, she herself was drifting off to sleep. 

*********************************************************************************
Betty was still dozing when she heard the sound of the shower. Steve was getting
himself ready for work. She lay there and felt the stickiness between her thighs.
She blinked her eyes and glanced over at the clock. She could feel the inner push
to get up and join him as normally she would be going to work too she remembered
that she didn't have to. She licked the back of her teeth and realised that she
hadn't cleaned her teeth the previous night. Now she felt dirty but not in a sexy
way. She pulled back the duvet and strolled into the bathroom. The steam wafted 
out and with it the smell of the shower gel. Steve was singing. Obviously in a 
good mood. He turned off the water and was reaching for the towel. Betty handed
it to him. He dried his face and then gave her a kiss. She returned a bleary-eyed
smile.
"Morning", she said,"you're so bright this morning. He continued to dry himself
and looked at her reflection in the mirror. He wiped part of the mirror to make
her clearer and to see himself. As he filled the sink for his shave and lathered
his face he told her why he was feeling in such a positive mood.
"Betty, don't take this the wrong way, 'cos I don't mean disrespect to your 
sister but after our conversation with Eric yesterday I just feel so lucky to
have you." He paused as stetched his cheek and aimed the razor. A straight razor
which he had just stropped. He pinched his nose with his left hand and shaved his
above upper lip. He rinsed his razor and continued.
"We still got each other and we're about to get married. I mean hell, we're just
lucky to be alive after these damn attacks. So many didn't make it."
He changed hands and shaved his left cheek and then the throat. He rinsed the
razor again and then his whole face. Relathered. Started from the throat upwards
shaving against the grain this time.
"It's made me realise that we can go at any time. We just don't know when. I mean
who the hell would have expected an airplane to come crashing into the World Trade
Center. All those lives. Just cut off. You know. Gone. And it could easily have
you or me."
Betty was listening but had sat down to use the toilet. She didn't feel that he
was disrespecting Anne, in fact she thought that what he was saying addressed 
what she herself had been feeling but unable to articulate. She wrapped the paper
around her fingers and tore it from the roll. when she stood up to flush Steve
was emptying the sink and rinsing off the last of the lather. 
"Not bad, not bad at all", he said looking at himself in the close-up mirror. 
Betty stroked his cheek and kissed it. He put on a shy smile and turned towards
her. She smiled back and stroked his head. He pulled her close and hugged her.
They stayed like that for a long while. Then he pulled away.
"I never want to take any of this for granted. I don't want to complain about 
the things that are wrong in our lives only to stay focused on the positive, that
we have each other. We have our health and we're not broke. And we have our whole
lives ahead of us. I want that to always be in the forefront of my mind. If that
makes me one of those cheesy happy smiley people who seem to be up no matter what
then so be it, I don't care. But we have to make the most of this before it's 
taken away from us."
Steve picked up his watch to put on his wrist.
"Oh shit! I need to get going", he said, "better grab some coffee".
Even if he wasn't going to eat he was going to have coffee. He could easily get
a pastry at work and probably have another coffee. He managed to finish getting
dressed while the coffee brewed and drank it in a few mouthfuls before saying his
goodbyes and getting out the door. Betty followed him into the kitchen while he
did his final preparations. She thought about what he had said as the door 
closed behind him and she was all alone. It was quiet and empty and there were 
no tasks ahead of her aside from general maintenance. She stopped staring at the
door and went back to the bathroom and stepped into the shower. The steam had 
only just started to clear and now it was coming back. After a few moments she
found that she was just standing there without actually washing or moving. There
was nothing wrong with that except that the bathtub was a much better way of 
achieving that. She turned off the shower and started to fill the tub. She went
back to the kitchen and found that there was still some coffee left over. It 
was fresh so she poured it out and took it back to the bathroom. She took the 
newspapers from the previous day and put them on a chair next to the bathtub.
She wiped the mirror and combed her hair. She wondered who she was. A victim of
a wounded city. The bath was almost full so she turned off the taps. No nausea
today or a headache. What about the breast? She drew back the bathrobe and put
her right hand up to it. Still looked inflamed but there wasn't any tenderness
as there was the previous day. The nipple looked weird though but only very
slightly. She put it down to a heavy hangover coupled with grief. Perhaps the
general malaise of the city was working its way through all of its inhabitants.
As long as she could ascribe it to something it didn't matter. But nothing that
would require any form of treatment stronger than an aspirin or rest. The pain
was gone so she stopped worrying, slipped of her robe and stepped into the tub.
It was a teeny bit too hot but that's how she liked it. If it was just right
now then in a few minutes the water would cool down and she would get used to
it and then it would feel too cold. So it was better to start with it just a 
little too warm then the effect of her body cooling the water and her growing
accustomed to the temperature meant that she could stay in her comfort zone 
for much longer. Once her whole body was in the water she reached across to
the chair and picked up the coffee and took some big sips. Only warm now. Then
one very big sip to finish the cup. She put it back and then took one of the
papers and folded it up so that she could read it without getting it wet. She
skimmed the headlines for an article that might interest her but it was all
related to the aftermath of the Trade Center attacks. She tried to find things
that she hadn't seen the day before but there wasn't much. She put down the 
papers as she was wanting to get her arms and hands into the water. She sank
lower till only her face was out of the water and she could hear heart beating.
She could also hear herself breathing. She could feel she shockwave of the 
heartbeat echo through her whole body, rippling from the centre outwards. No
movement apart from these vital organs. Her metaphorical heart seemed to be
frozen in time. Instead of water that could have been ice. Her mind began to
spring into action once more and she remembered what Steve had said about the
fact that he didn't want to take anything for granted. Especially not her and
what they had. But what did they have? Was it really special? Was it not just
something that everyone has? And what about her? what did she want? How did
she feel? Her process didn't feel as linear or as textbook as Steves or as
Erics. 
All these ideas played themselves out in her mind as she lay motionless in the
tub being acutely aware of her heart and lungs as well as the sound of the 
drop of water falling from the tap. She could see the steam rising from the
surface of the water and could feel her problems evaporate and merge with the
rest of the steam in the room.
She started to think about her wedding: it was coming soon. She was going to
marry the man she loved. Did she love him? Yes she did. But did she trust him?
She wasn't sure. She hadn't told him about the little turn that she'd had and
she needed to talk about it. No she didn't. Why was there a need to talk about
something that was so much of nothing. He would get all worried and he would
want her to go to the hospital and there would be so much fussing and how they
were in it together and that they would see it through. No, she didn't want any
of that. And besides it was nothing. This morning it was all gone. No pain in 
her breast, no nausea and no headache. The nipple did look a bit wierd and so
she had hidden that away. But no big deal; it would sort itself out. Only a
hiccup. But Steve could easily have made it more than it was. That was all. It
wasn't that she didn't trust him, it was more a case of letting minor things
remain on the periphery of her life while she got on with the big stuff. Focus
on the main goals in her life. But what were they? Getting married? Having a 
child? Climbing the career ladder? Were they her goals or were they everyones
goals and she'd just bought into them? I mean she did want those things but did
she want them because she ought to want them? Anne didn't really want those 
things. She couldn't have got married. She would have had no time for children
unless she changed job and she was so dedicated that she would never have never
have changed job. And climbing the career ladder would have meant she wouldn't
be seeing the action. She was exactly where she wanted to be. Her goal wasn't 
to improve herself or her life but simply to maintain. She had no plans to go
on holiday or developing new skills apart from those that might improve her
ability to be more effective when she arrived on the scence. Anne's life seemed
so clear. She was respected and what she did was honourable. She was exempt from
having to pursue those goals that others were expected to have. Was that all it
was then? Expectation? Were people simply expected to improve their careers, 
get married and have children? Betty tried hard but she couldn't really separate
the two. On the one hand she did want to improve her career at least in terms 
of her earnings and handle the bigger clients she thought. She did want to have
children and she also wanted to get married. But were they what she herself 
wanted or what was expected of her? She couldn't really figure that one out. Had
she simply absorbed a collective goal and made it hers? So in actual fact it was
not really her plan or ambition but one that belonged to society and she being 
part of that society was championing their cause but at the same time being 
blind to her own individual needs and wants. Was that the case? Had she made a
sacrifice without even knowing that she had? Had society duped her into thinking
that what she wanted now was not a collective dream, the American dream or at 
least the dream that was shared within her peer group? If that was the case then
the group or the world had managed to pull over her eyes for a long time. She 
started to get a little irritated that this could actually be true. But why 
would society at large create such an illusion and get everyone to buy into it?
Industry? Something to keep the workers happy so that the fatcats could have a
lifelong slave.  
Betty realised that her thoughts had taken a turn that was subversive and that
if she continued in that line of argument then it could easily spiral out of 
control. Best to leave her mental meanderings at that point go out for a run.
The water was starting to get cold anyway. She got changed into her running gear
and out to Washington Square Park. It was a sunny morning but a cold yet 
stalwart mood still prevailed. The city had been hit hard but the inhabitants
were not going to cower in fright. They all got on with their lives standing 
proud. She ran at an easy pace going a touch faster when she felt the irritation
rising in her. She was a regular runner so she wasn't worried about overdoing it
or getting out of breath. Her plan was to run for half an hour or so and then 
get a snack in the park. If she felt like continuing her run after that time 
that was OK too. She felt reasonably fit in spite of having taken the previous
day off and a spell of heavy drinking. She was wearing a sports bra but could 
still feel a slight something in her left breast. She put it down to her 
imagination or that it wasn't fitting properly that morning. But it was slight
enough for her to ignore it. After about 40 minutes she decided to take a rest
and eat a hot dog. She ate about half of it and realised that she wasn't too
hungry after all. She sat on the bench for a little wondering what Anne would
be doing if she were alive right now. Doing what mattered and doing what mattered
to her.
*********************************************************************************
Betty spent the rest of her week off doing much the same as that Monday. She 
started the day with a long bath followed by a run, breakfast in the park or in
a nearby cafe and some shopping on the way home. She had been given one week of 
paid leave and her boss had been kind enough to allow her to take more time if
she needed as unpaid leave or use some of her holiday allowance. Stocks had taken
a dive and she was wondering if this compassion was just a front to sweeten the
blow when it came to letting her go. She was a good worker but there were many 
like her where she worked: perhaps it was time to trim the fat. She was required
but not indispensible. She hadn't reached that level of responsibility just yet.
She was close but not close enough. The last time she'd had a break like this was
when she was at university, having the whole day to herself and deciding when she
would do what. It took a little discipline on her part but the rewards were worth
it so long as she didn't get too distracted. The day was a small unit of your 
whole life and if you could steer your way through the day doing what you wanted
and creating an atmosphere that was conducive to the way you saw the world then 
that was a day lived well. If the rest of your days could be like that then that
was a good result. Betty wondered why these were the only times when people with
regular jobs and careers got time off like this. When they were sick or when they
had children or a bereavement. They had paid holiday time of course but that 
usually entailed going off to some other destination to get away from the usual
day to day and enjoy the luxury of something that couldn't be had at home. It 
then involved coming home and sharing those tales with friends and colleagues. 
But the main activity of life was work with only a few short interludes. Even 
weekends involved doing home admin, housework and a little social interaction. 
It was often social obligation rather than purely fun. How about a week that was
an extension of a weekend she thought. Going to the museum, the cinema and taking
time reading the newspaper at a cafe. The kinds of things that most people did 
at the weekend but repeated over a whole week. Three weekends in a row. After the
activities were exhausted of interest they would become vehicles to create a 
sense of structure and routine now that there was no 9-5 work period to give that
structure. And once the activities became banal and empty then the real yearning
that underlies our day to day can come up to the surface and we have time to
examine it in a controlled environment called the week-weekend. A mini sabbatical
if you like where we can gauge our own plans and desires against that of the 
collective. Do we fit the profile of the American dream? Do we really want kids,
better career and a family life? People in better paid jobs can look down on 
those that work on the factory floor and rejoice in the fact that they are not
thoughtless automatons working from hand to mouth and locked in a state of affairs
where no amount shifting the goal posts can change their situation. They had 
enough money to enjoy a certain amount of leisure and to consume luxury goods
but that still meant being tied to their career. They were valued workers hired
for their skills and trusted with decisions. But even though they were higher up
the scale than the average labourer they were still only a small part of something
that was much bigger and needed to be kept silent. The better pay, the access to 
more affluent leisure pursuits and the ability to live in sought after location
all made it seem to them that they had made something of their lives but were 
they just part of a collective over which they had very little control?

Betty allowed these thoughts come up in her mind and tried not to accept or reject
them while she spent her week creating a week-weekend for herself. She wondered
if new mothers spent their days in this way but looking after the baby would take
up all or most of their time. I guess a nanny would help she thought. After her
run and cafe for brunch, newspapers and reflection she would get a few things for
the evening meal and take her time preparing it. This wasn't something that she 
did in the past even at the weekend but she was enjoying and Steve was appeciating
it too. He was wondering if that would be the way of things when they were 
married. But they had been living together for a few years so why would anything
change just because they were married. There was another social convention. Even
though many couples live together all their lives without even thinking about 
getting married for some reason as soon as they did get married even though it
was just a piece of paper things did change. It wasn't just a continuation of 
living together as they had been, there was a much stronger bond and people 
perceived them differently too. Attitudes had changed over the years but not in
this respect. Why did Steve who was a forward thinking kind of guy start to 
imagine that his future wife would start preparing the evening meal on a regular
basis once they were married? That idea had been wired into his psyche somewhere
along the line and he obviously hadn't noticed. But at that moment as Betty was
serving him his plate of food he caught hold of his train of thought and stopped
himself from saying it before he did. Betty noticed that something was amiss and
quipped about it.
"Oh I'm sorry dear, let me pour your wine", said Betty filling his glass with
the air of the perfect 50's housewife. "Look at the kitchen darling, isn't it
so clean? And I made cupcakes too." 
Steve stared at her open mouthed and wondered if she had heard him thinking. He
was about to mention it but just said thanks and sipped his wine playing along
with her parody. It was the end of the week of compassionate leave and Betty was
wondering if she should take another week. Once she had served herself and sat
down she put joking aside and began to tell Steve about the week that she had
had and he listened intently.
"I like doing the housewife thing but I don't think I could keep it up for very
long. I love my work and I love the routine it gives me. But it has been a 
useful time for me just to drop everything for a while. You know, I've been 
calling it a week-weekend. I've tried to make the week like an extended weekend.
We're used to just putting our feet up for a weekend and taking in a little R &
R but if we have a longer break then we try and organise something, you know,
like a trip or something. It did cross my mind but I just wanted to be here at
home and just have that weekend feeling. I mean it's like a short-term mental
illness. I guess that's how the industry would see it. When their workers are 
bereaved they possibly consider it like they're sick and then at some point they
are well again and come back to work. It's a cold economic way of putting it but
paid leave costs a company money. Anyway, it was nice to feel like a tourist in 
my own city, seeing everyone else doing their day to day things and while their
weekend was over mine was continuing. I'm wondering about the idea of taking one
more week. It would be unpaid this time though as we've got the honeymoon coming
up pretty soon."
Steve put down his fork and reached across to put his hand on Betty's arm.
"You take as long as you need. There is no finite amount of time for this process.
You think it's all done and you feel you can go on with your life and then you
realise that it's not over at all." Steve wasn't talking about Betty any more but
he was still on point.
"I think I will you know. I haven't had a break like this in a long time and even
though I am actually missing work a little, can you believe that, just a few more
days should see me through. Then I'll be able to carry on with the daily grind."
"Sure. Yeah. Good idea. You can always call me at work if you need to talk. I'm
not always available but I mean if something comes up and you just need to mull
something over, you know, I'm there for you." He was still feeling left out of
her inner life but less so than before.
Betty nodded and thanked him. But they had the evening to talk but usually by 
then her time for reflection had passed.

After a relaxing Saturday and Sunday weekend with Steve, Betty started another
week on leave another week-weekend as she was calling it. She decided that in 
that second week she would call Steve during the day at some point in order to
keep him in the loop. In fact she called him the very next day. It was more of
the same slighly political state of society reflections that she'd been having.
Steve was slightly tired of these ideas before and were sort of subversive ideas
that most students have when they're at university and promptly forget when they
land their first job. They had a good life and they had a good family and even 
though it was interesting to talk about these things he couldn't see that they
were in any way relevant to his or her life and he couldn't see that either of
them would make any changes based on those discussions. Which of course begged
the question why even have them? Why talk this stuff if it didn't lead to any
course of action? Steve wasn't much of an ideas guy it seemed. He liked to 
discuss things only as a means of reaching a conclusion. He couldn't see any
other point to a discussion. He was willing to listen to someone when they 
needed an ear but again this was in line with his code that it was leading to a
logical end point i.e. the person would feel better as a result of unloading 
their burden. But talking about an idea purely to discuss it and develop it 
seemed a little indulgent. Betty knew this of course and had spared him on many
occassions but as he had asked to be kept in the loop she complied. She figured
that if she didn't call him the rest of the week to keep him updated then he 
wouldn't mind for fear that she would again ask him to listen to her political
cum philosophical ideas. He wasn't interested and he was also against them. He
wasn't going to start arguing against her and make a big thing of it so Betty
felt safe to continue her week-weekend on her own. Even though these ideas were
of no interest to Steve and she'd thrown them at him as a means of leaving her
alone, she herself did find them important and interesting. Why did they keep
coming up? Why was she questioning her way of living? After her run she went to
the same coffee shop that week and sat with her newspaper to enjoy her brunch.
She was always alone although one of her colleagues did come and join her one
day for a brief interlude. They weren't friends outside of work but they did 
have a connection of sorts. Betty told her that she'd be back the following week
and that she was doing OK. She knew this would get back to the office and that 
even though this so called friend did genuinely mean well and offered support 
she was in fact snooping and actually wanted to see Betty more upset than she
was. Betty needed to show her that she wasn't some total blubbering wreck but at
the same time that she was suffering and that she did find the loss difficult, 
which she did of course but in spite of it all, in spite of the grief, she was
still fit for work. The department was downsizing and some of her contemporaries
were already out. Anyone could be next and someone who wasn't up to the job was
the most likely candidate. It would be cruel blow delivered with a smile and 
most of her colleagues wouldn't see it coming but she needed to stay ahead of
the game. Even though Betty's colleague had come to assess Betty, Betty also 
had the opportunity to assess the state of affairs at the office and her 
department. It seemed that if she wanted to keep her job then she would have
to return the following week ready or not.

Once her colleague had left she continued with the newspapers for a little while
as it was a good way to reflect without seeming that that was what you were 
doing. You could stare at an article appearing to be reading it but really taking
your mind elsewhere. It was once again about life, work and social obligations
and how many of her goals were actually her own and how many were seeds that had
been planted by society and had now matured into fully fledged desires. Did she
want children or did society want her to have children? But as Steve was saying,
why even take the time to consider any of these things if there was no end result?
She wasn't going to change job, change her lifestyle, give up on the idea of 
having a family or getting married. Or was she? Steve wasn't worried but he asked
anyway one day. Of course she wasn't but she just couldn't understand why she 
was compelled to think about it. But she also thought about Steve's philosophy
that was essentially about appreciating what he had never taking it for granted.
She concluded that if he was appeciating what he had then he didn't want anything
else. This somehow seemed a bit of a narrow view to her. She viewed her own 
situation as fake having had these reflections for almost two weeks and in a way
Steve's philosophy was reinforcing her ideas that society strives to maintain the
status quo. It creates a set of norms and then each of its members supports all
attempts to maintain those norms and challenges all attempts to change it. He 
was grateful for what he had and realised that it could be taken away at any time.
But was he truly happy with what he had? He still had his life when many others
were dead. He still had his partner when many didn't. He had a good job and one
which he enjoyed. He had a bright future ahead and all of this pleased him a 
great deal. But it was as though he hadn't chosen any of these things himself. 
He had been presented with them and he had accepted. He hadn't looked within his
soul to find out who he was and what he really wanted from life. He had settled
for comfort and convenience and had no time for his soul. At least that was how
Betty saw it. She hadn't been one for looking within herself but lately she didn't
need to do that, the within was making its way without. She merely needed to sit
back and observe. It made her question every aspect of her life and her reason 
for doing all of the things that she did. She needed more time to explore these
ideas both on a personal level and also on a universal one. But if she wanted to
keep her job then it was time to close this chapter and get back to the facts 
and figures of the banking world. Perhaps that was why people weren't allowed to
take long breaks in case they started to think about life and then quit work.

*********************************************************************************
Two weeks had not been enough to explore her newly emerging inner life. A life 
that she didn't know existed. But it was also a life that no-one seemed to care
about especially her man. It obviously brought her relationship with him into
question. They had lived together for many years and she thought she knew what 
she was getting herself into but new evidence had come to light showing that
perhaps he was not the one. But she was not ready to pass judgement quite yet.
The nausea, headaches and cramps around her left breast had come and gone during
those two weeks but she had continued to ignore them and told herself that it 
was nothing serious and did not require any anxiety or attention. But she did
miss Anne. Even though they didn't see each other that often due to the nature
of her work, they were sisters and there was a connection that she would have
with no-one else. Anne lived from the heart and didn't care about the things 
that most people cared about such as money, social standing, family and being
successful which most people attributed to wealth. She just wanted to serve her
community and she let nothing stop her from doing that. She understood the 
fragility of life and she knew that there was no time for procrastination. You
had to live your life right now, this very minute as tomorrow it could be too
late. Each day she did her job rescuing victims of injuries she realised this
fact more and more deeply. It was now or never. For a lot of her patients it
had been a close call. If you got list of stuff you want to do in your life 
then damn well make a start, the dishes can wait she would say. You turn around
for a second and you could miss it. It was only now after her untimely demise
that Betty was starting to understand Anne's outlook on life. Now grieving her
sisters death she was realising that her very own sister had a vision of life
that was much closer to the truth than hers. Her own vision or philosophy was
one step removed from reality whereas her apprehended its true nature. This 
was why she was able to exhibit such fearlessness in the face of such trauma
and face it over and over again. Her life was dedicated to others and she took
her own life in her hands every day that she did her job. Most people take it
for granted that someone has to do the job of a paramedic and fly to the scene
of an accident and take charge of an injured victim. But for Betty it was her
own sister and she had been so proud of her. Now she had made the ultimate
sacrifice. She would remain ultimately blameless and pure but another unsung
hero that would soon be forgotten and other better documented ones would be
among the ones that are remembered. It angered Betty that Anne's life wouldn't
be recognised and that she wouldn't be celebrated as a great life in the halls
of history but that some corrupt politican due to their position in society 
would go down in the books. She thought of Anne as an anonymous philanthropist
whose contribution meant a great deal to the cause. This idea comforted her
somewhat but didn't stop her from being angry at the personages that would be
standing in the limelight for works of far less merit.

But it was time to put her grieving and reflections about life to one side in
order to back to work. She had already gathered that her department at Wells
Fargo were needing to make cuts to their staff especially after the trade 
center attacks and sending the city into an economic decline. Some of her 
colleagues had already been dismissed which left the others grappling to 
maintain their own position. This sense of self preservation and general self
interest put them on constant alert and the atmosphere was not as she had left
it. Everyone knew that further cuts were on the agenda and the workforce would
be further reduced over the coming months. It was the countdown to Christmas
and Thanksgiving which was sure to give their bosses a deadline in their minds.
The attitude was not only to make themselves look good but to make others look
bad. In fact they spent more time and effort in trying to make their co-workers
look bad. Gathering evidence of mistakes and anything that would weaken their
case when pleading to maintain their jobs. If the current workers could oust
the dead wood themselves then it would save their bosses the trouble of doing
so themselves, at least that was their theory. They had turned into hack
journalists digging up the dirt on sports personalities and celebrities in the
hope of getting a scoop. But they weren't after the scoop, only to see their
victim fall in the eyes of the public.

It was an environment that Betty had never witnessed in her place of work. There
a few nasty ones who would stab you in the back for no reason other than the
satisfation of doing so but now they were all at it. She would have to do the
same if she was to survive. But were there factions? Could she join one? She was
fresh meat even though she had been a high performer in the past. On her very 
first day back she could see the false smiles and her so called friends moving
in to dig the dirt. The first few days were easy as she was still nourished by
that carefree attitude that comes from having two weeks at home living at a 
leisurely pace. But by the end of the first week she too was getting worried
about keeping her job and keeping a tally of who was most likely to go next
and how best to send them over the edge. She hated herself for behaving in that
way but it was dog eat dog and if she didn't do it to someone else then sure 
enough someone was going to do it to her. This was something that Steve did
understand and was indeed willing to discuss. Betty once again connected with
him in a way that she wanted to connect on other levels too but for the time
being this would have to do. He seemed content that he was connected to Betty
again and that she was opening up to him. But for her it was all very superficial
and she knew that she would never be able to connect with him on things that 
matters most to her. But her survival at the office was important to both of
them so a certain amount of self interest drove his motivation to help. But he
genuinely loved her and he did care. 

The following week two people lost their jobs. One of them was indeed one that
Betty suspected would go soon and whom she believed she had toppled by showing
her bosses errors that they themselves had consealed. The one thing that the
workers in that department didn't know is how far the bosses were willing to
go. When would they stop? How far were they downsizing? The general consensus
was that the figure was cutting staff by 30% but it was only agreed estimate
and there was no evidence to back up this claim. Betty thought it was probably
more than this but couldn't figure out where this figure had arisen. Had the 
bosses circulated it themselves in order to quickly move through the first
round and then watch the remain workforce carefully after the infighting had
ceased? Others believed this too but not everyone. Nobody dared to find this
information for fear of being blacklisted by their colleagues. It was a police
state in miniature.

As October continued more of her colleagues left the department. They were 
mostly from the shortlist that were predicted to be leaving but there were also
some that left voluntarily. Certain of the voluntary redundancies were very 
surprising to her and to her current confidantes. One was the leader of an 
opposing faction who was declaring that they would never leave and no amount
dirt on their character would be enough to get them fired. What had happened?
Why had they gone that way? Probably a better offer elsewhere. It was to 
throw them off the scent while they were looking for work elsewhere. A very 
risky strategy as it was not only her company that was cutting back but most of
New York. Profits were down all over the city.

Whether it was the stress of the her work environment or another factor she 
didn't know but through October the symptoms that she had felt during the 
morning after the funeral returned with a force and vigour that were comparable
to the original. Perhaps even more so. On more than two occassions she quietly
went to the restrooms and vomited. If this got out to her colleagues it would
be another point against her. Headaches and dizzy spells and sometimes just 
feeling weak. It was hard work to pretend that it wasn't happening as this was
something that she really didn't need on top of all that had happened recently.
The pain in her left breast returned and sometimes felt so acute that even a 
full dose of painkillers wouldn't numb the pain. Was she pregnant? Was that the
reason? That would explain the nausea and vomiting. But what about the headaches
and the pain in the breast? The nipple was looking misshapen too. That surely
required the examination of a doctor did it not? She and Steve hadn't planned
to have children by having sex according to a calendar but as Betty was in her
late thirties they thought it best to move towards children gently but having
unprotected sex whenever they had sex. This took the pressure off them 'trying'
to have a child and possibly failing, as many of their friends had done and then
going through that disappointment. Or else getting pregnant very soon and having
to plan for the child before they had even got used to the idea. Their idea was
to simply have unprotected sex as and when their desires arose and if that sex
led to pregnancy then they would plan for the child but if it didn't then there
was still plenty of time for it to happen. But Betty hadn't missed a period since
her last one so this couldn't be a pregnancy. Perhaps a test kit would rule out
that possibility once and for all.

The pregnancy test kit that she bought showed negative. She bought another brand
and that showed negative too. She used the tests at home making sure to buy them
on the way home as pregnancy would be one big black mark against her and she 
could more or less guarantee getting fired. But in spite of her efforts to be 
discreet Steve found the test kit and confronted her. Over dinner one evening he
put the box on the table and demanded an explanation.
"What's this? How come this was in the trash?" asked Steve, trying his best not
to sound angry.
"It's a pregnancy test kit", said Betty trying to avoid the real question.
"OK, I can see that, I can read, but why is it in our trash?" asked Steve, this
time a little enraged.
"Because I put it there, OK. Does that answer your question?" said Betty raising
her voice and getting up from the table.
"Betty, what the fuck. When were you going to tell me about this? I mean if we
have children then we do it together. We talked about the whole thing together
and that we weren't going to try", he did bunny ear quotation marks with his 
fingers when he said try, "like most of our friends. Has something happened?
Are you pregnant? Betty, talk to me, what's going on?" Steve was feeling his old
insecurities again but now at least he had a subject that she might be hiding
and she also had a way to tell him something to appease him but still continue 
to hide. Steve had stood up but had now sat down again. Betty was in front of
the bathroom mirror looking at herself and thinking. Once she realised that 
this was a way to tell part of the truth she came back to the table and sat
down again.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you out of this. I know you're my man and
we're team and we're about to get married and we should talk about stuff like
this and anything we need to talk about. But ..." 
"But what?" asked Steve
"But when Anne died it was like I wasn't in a team any more. We had been the 
team, she and I. Even though we were doing our own things now the connection
was still there and suddenly she was gone. I just felt alone. So alone."
Steve was hurt by this comment but he let her continue.
"It was like we were kids again and I was a kid on my own. She was younger than
me but it was like she was the older one. She was the tough one. She was the one
who would take the risks and make the snap decisions. So I got to rely on her to
do that. Like I had deferred those responsibilities onto her. But she was gone
so who was going to do them now? Fuck. I'm sorry, this coming out like you're 
not in the picture at all, but it's not like that, you matter so much to me".
And he did, but right now he felt like the tiniest insect in her garden. She 
had wanted to open up to him but she knew that he wouldn't be able to take it.
He always needed to be reassured about being the centre of attention in her life.
Such an insecure idiot but she loved him anyway. Best to just tell him about the
test rather than explain why she hadn't told him before.
"I was feeling nauseous at work and threw up a couple of times and I thought 
that maybe I was pregnant so I got the test. The test was negative so I threw
it in the trash. I was a little disappointed to be honest and so I didn't tell
you. I figured that you would be disappointed too. I haven't missed a period so
I was thinking that I was probably wasn't pregnant but thought I'd just check 
to be sure. You see these things on TV don't you."
Steve had sat and listened while Betty had pleaded her case. Now it was his turn
to speak.
"I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have shouted at you or been angry with you. I know
it's been hard with Anne and all. But you know what I'm like when I get left out
of the picture. I'm so scared of losing you. I know I probably don't need to be."
"You don't need to be", replied Betty.
"I know, but I can't help it. It's just how I am. I'm paranoid and insecure and
I need reassurance. And I sure as hell appeciate that I can talk about that and
that it doesn't put you off."
"It doesn't, you know it doesn't".
"I love you Betty and I want to marry you and I want to have a family with you
and I just wish I could put these stupid fears and anxieties to one side but I
can't. I can't." He thumped the table gently but in frustrated way. "I don't
deserve someone like you".
"Steve, just stop it. This isn't going get us nowhere. Look at me. I love you
too. I mean it Steve, I'm not just saying it. And I want to marry you too and
have a family with you. I'm part of this fucking team. I can't do it without you
either." She reached across the table and grabbed his hand which was still balled
up in a fist. He unclenched it and let it relax. He blubbed a little and nodded.
"I'm here for you just as you're here for me. OK. Sometimes it's going to be
tough and if you work together we might just make it. What do you say?"
"OK. Yeah. OK." 
"Are you disappointed about the pregnancy or lack of it should I say?" asked Betty
"Yeah, I am. You were right to not tell me. But it's brought it home to me that
this is a real possiblity now rather than something that is far away in the 
future. It could happen soon." he said.
"Well, probably sooner than you think", she said with a slight grin," you wanna
go and try". She did the rabbit ear fingers as she said the word try.
Before Steve had had a chance to answer Betty had stood up and was drawing him 
towards the bedroom. He didn't protest but allowed himself to be led. He closed
the bedroom door behind him and at the sound of the door closing Betty could feel
that she was one step ahead again and getting some make up sex to boot.
*********************************************************************************
Towards the end of October when Betty was feeling more secure at work and also 
more secure with Steve she felt less secure about her health. The symptoms she
had experienced were still continuing and it she couldn't avoid them any longer.
It was time to visit the doctor. After a consultation with her local physician
he suggested a trip to the hospital for a scan. He didn't like the look of her
breast and even though she was below the median age range it was still worth
checking to see if there was something to worry about. Her doctor suggested
St. Vincents hospital but Betty told the doctor she would prefer to go to another
one even if it was further away. Her sister had died at St. Vincents and it was
also too close to her workplace. The second reason she didn't tell her doctor
but the first was enough for him to reconsider his suggestion. There was also
a third reason that she didn't want to run into Steve. It wasn't that she didn't
want him to know what was going on but only at a later stage when she was clear
about it first.

The appointment was for lunchtime on the 31st of October. Was that a bad omen.
Trick or treat? It was a hospital that she had never visited before. She had 
her appointment letter with her which she had had delivered to her office so that
Steve would have no chance of seeing it. The reception desk confirmed her and 
told her the way to the relevant department. The followed the signs along the
corridors until she found the waiting room. There were four people waiting there
all reading magazines and each of them looked up briefly before going back to
their magazines. Nothing happened. There was the sound of a page turning, the
occassional sigh and the sound of footsteps. When there was movement in or out
of the room all the heads looked in unison and dropped again when it was clear
that it didn't concern them. Betty was early and it looked as though the others
were before her in line. She was hoping to get back before her lunch break was
over but it didn't look as though that would be possible. A minute later a nurse
popped her head out from behind the door and mentioned one of the names. One of
the ladies nodded her head and went inside. The door closed and silence ensued.
Betty sat silently but she wasn't reading. She was trying to tell herself that
the waiting wouldn't last that long. Another five minutes passed and she found
herself reaching for the pile of magazines stacked on the table in front of the
chairs. There was one about exotic holidays. She thought about her honeymoon
which was only a month or so away. She flicked through it looking at the photos
and wondered how it might look in real life. The heat and the smells couldn't 
be captured in photos. That changed everything. And the poverty of course. Most
exotic locations were in deprived parts of the world and tourism was a big part
of their economy but it meant sucking up to their wealthy guests.

Two more people went into the room and there was now only one in front of Betty.
The queue was moving faster than she had imagined. Perhaps she would get back
to the office in good time and no-one would grow suspicious about her absence.
There were now four others flicking through magazines and finally the nurse 
came out and called out her name. Betty nodded, stood up and went inside. There
were two women inside. One was the radiologist and the other was the doctor.
The doctor greeted her and asked her to have a seat while she took some more
details. Then looked through the notes from her GP and asked her again about her
symptoms. She explained the procedure to Betty and she began to remove her shirt
and bra. The doctor examined her and took some notes. She tried to keep a poker
face and convey no meaning during this process. Then the radiologist helped her
to put her breast into the scanner and they both went out of the room for a 
moment while the x-rays fired. They scanned both breasts even though she had felt
pain in only one. From the appearance of the left breast and the nature of the 
nipple the doctor concluded that it was more than likely that she had a tumour.
There was no point beating about the bush as it would be delaying the inevitable
and it was better to know sooner rather than later so that treatment could be
started. The x-rays confirmed that there was indeed a tumour and that it was in
an advanced stage. The breast would need to be removed and there would be a 
course of chemotherapy following the mastectomy. But she would need to act very
soon before the situation got worse. The doctor suggested that she make an
appointment with an oncologist in order to discuss her options. She regretted to
have to bear her this bad news and was also sorry that she would have to usher
her out of the room to make way for the next patient. Betty was in shock. The
sheer disbelief was something that had been happening over the past month. First
911, then her sister and now this. Did she really have breast cancer? No, it was
too far fetched. It had to be something else. She got dressed quickly and said
thanks mechanically and left the room almost like zombie. 

What had just happened? She'd had her breast scanned and had been told that there
was a tumour and it was in an advanced stage and needed to be removed. It meant 
removing her whole breast and having chemotherapy. She went over it again as she
walked out of the hospital onto the street and hailed a cab. She sat in the cab
and stared out of the window. The driver was a chatty one and tried talking to her
but his voice seemed to come from a far distant place. He was a very jovial person
and kept up his monologue hoping to turn it into a dialogue. She nodded occassionally
and smiled but she wasn't really listening. In her mind she was listening to the 
doctors words over and over again. She was letting it sink in. It was as thought she
had gone there without cancer and had come home with it. Wouldn't it have been better
if she hadn't gone there? Perhaps then she wouldn't have cancer. Cancer at 35. She 
couldn't believe it. But it was her and it was happening. It may sound far fetched
but if you had told someone that a jet airliner would be crashing into the World
Trade Center they would not have believed you either. She didn't want it to be real
but it was real. How the hell was she going to keep this from her colleagues? They
would see that something was wrong. She could say that she was still upset about
her sister, which she was and had been to visit her grave. She wished that she 
didn't have to go through this kind of deception but that's just how it was.
*********************************************************************************
For two more days Betty went to work and followed her normal workday routine and
then arrived at the weekend. For those two days she had kept her news to herself.
In a week's time her wedding was taking place and today was the rehearsal. They
had originally planned to have a big wedding with friends coming from all over
but after the trade center attacks they wondered if they should postpone their
plans. First of all they decided that they would still continue with big wedding
idea but wait till everything had calmed down. But then Anne's death meant that
many of the would be guests attended her funeral. So they put everything on hold.
But Steve decided that the wedding was really for them, him and her and that the
guests didn't matter too much. He wanted to go ahead on the original date and 
take his vows with Betty and show some strength that he would not be beaten down
by adversity. Some friends thought this was in bad taste and others couldn't 
make it because lots of flights were cancelled or severely delayed due to the
security. Everything had been booked and ordered so why put it off. All that was
required was cut back on a few things and have a more intimate ceremony and 
reception. Steve needed this because he needed things to go as planned. He could
not handle too many unexpected events and too many changes of plan. He still had
his job and his girl in spite of the city being turned upside down. He said that
he needed to appreciate what he had and his way of doing that was to hold on more
tightly to it. For him, getting married was the ideal move. For Betty it was a 
way to keep him quiet and right now keep her distracted. She didn't want to think
about things right now. There were too many things. 

It was Saturday morning and Betty and Steve weren't about to do what they usually
did at the weekend. They were up early and they were going through their vows.
Steve took his suit off the hanger but didn't remove it from the plastic. That 
was for the following week, this week he would wear one of his regular suits. He
had had his haircut at lunchtime on Friday so he was feeling quite the dandy.
Betty was looking at her own dress but had it hidden inside a cover so Steve
wouldn't see it. In some ways it was just a formality as they had been living
together for a while but she was looking forward to the pomp and the ceremony.
She looked through her evening dresses and chose something that might be fitting
for a registry office wedding where the full bridal attire wouldn't be suitable.
When they had chosen their clothes they looked through their vows. It was still 
early and Betty wanted to go for a run. Steve was a little anxious and wondered
if that would give them enough time. Betty needed a run. She told him that she
would go for a short run and take a very quick shower and get changed as soon
as she was back. He agreed but continued fussing over getting the whole thing
right. Good thing it was the rehearsal rather than the wedding. 

Betty ran at a slightly faster pace to get the same sort of workout that she got
from her usual morning run. But this was Saturday and usually she ran for longer.
She felt that she was being cheated from her routine. The moment she was alone 
she was thinking about the cancer again. The words of the doctor telling her that
she would have to have one breast removed and then begin a course of chemotherapy.
But what if she didn't do that then what? How long would it be before the cancer 
would consume her? What did most people do? Did they all have the treatment? Was
there a choice? It wasn't time to think about this, it was time to pretend that
it wasn't happening. She ran faster and faster till the force of her breathing 
was causing a burning sensation in her chest. Still she pushed on till there just
was not enough oxygen coming into her body and it just stopped breathing heavily
and forcefully even though she willed herself to go on. She bent her knees and 
put her hands upon them while bending forward and continuing to breathe hard. A 
few moments later it all calmed down and she realised that she ought to be getting
back. Steve was still fussing and trying on diffent ties when she came back into
the flat. She went straight into the shower and rinsed off the sweat. Just five
minutes later she was out. She wrapped her hair in a towel and then dried off
with another towel. In the bedroom she found the dress she had chosen earlier
and chose some underwear to go with it. She put them on and then looked through
her shoes. She removed the head towel and with a brush and hairdryer worked at
getting it fully dry. When it was dry enough she started to put on the dress.
She needed steve to come and zip her up. When Steve came into the room he was
quite taken aback. Here was his bride to be. He saw her in a different way to
the Betty that he saw every day. He stopped fussing and calmed down. He did
the zipping up with care and attention and watched as she slipped into her shoes.
He had been in the process of tying his tie but hadn't quite finished it. Betty
performed that task: a wifely duty if ever there was one. 

They took a cab to the church. It was a beautiful church with stained glass 
windows and big stone steps leading up to the entrance. A church with the 
grandeur of a cathedral. They had chosen it for that very reason. Steve was more
of a religious person than Betty's family and it was through is church contacts
that they had been able to use this venue. Betty thought the venue was a pretty
one but it wasn't essential for her to be married in a church. But Steve was
a lot more traditional and for him it was a case of no church, no wedding. It was
marriage in the eyes of God. Some of the rehearsal guests had already arrived and
were gathering around the entrance. Betty's parents were there and so were Steve's.
It was as though they were getting married right then. Why had they gone to so much
trouble for the rehearsal. But there were no other guests. The parents both lived
in the city and it wasn't a great journey for them to come to this church. When
Betty saw her parents her head started to spin. The funeral came back to her and
the wake, throwing up the next day and having the time off that she did. She asked
Steve to go in and that she would follow him presently. He got worried for a moment
but soon saw her following. They had booked it for just half an hour which they 
thought was ample time to go through the ceremony. The organish was ready to play
and on the priest's signal he played the traditional wedding march. Betty walked
down the aisle holding an imaginary boquet of flowers and looking at the guests.
She came and stood next to Steve who was already there waiting. The organist 
stopped playing and the priest gave his dearly beloved speech as though the 
church was a full congregation. His voice and tone completely set the mood and
they were transported from being at a rehearsal to a wedding proper except that
he wasn't properly attired. They had no rings that day but they imagined. After
they had said their "I do's", they discussed a few things with the priest and 
confirmed the date for the following week.

It was at this point when they were all about to part company that Betty could
no longer hold back all that was within her. She wanted to shout it out at the
top of her lungs and hear it boom and echo around the walls of that church. But
even though she imagined herself doing it, not a word peeped out from her lips.
But her actions spoke louder than words. As the three couples were walking down
the aisle towards the door Betty turned around and went back to the priest and
in a matter of fact way asked him to get his diary out again. She looked Steve
straight in the face and told him that she wasn't ready. The following week 
was too soon and she needed a little longer. Postpone it for a month was what
she suggested. The priest seemed to be completely at ease as though a client
was changing a hotel booking. He checked his diary and said that it would be
fine. She turned to the others and asked them if early December would suit them.
They found their diaries and agreed that the date would suit them. But what
about Steve? He stood there silently not sure where to look. The priest took his
leave and quietly went into one of the doors. The organist began to practice a
hymn and the parents said their goodbyes quickly realising that they needed to
talk. Betty took Steve's arm and marched him out of the church. 


*********************************************************************************
When they left the church Betty and Steve walked down the steps silently and hailed
a cab to take them home. They remained silent until they were inside their apartment
and there was an agressive changing of clothes and avoiding each others gaze. Betty
made coffee and put it on the table near the window. She was rubbing her palms on
her thighs anxiously waiting for Steve to come and join her. She wanted to have a
civilised conversation with him rather than a shouting match. He sat down opposite
Betty and poured out his own cup and stirred in the milk. He watched her hands move
on her thighs and then stop when she noticed that he was watching them. He took a
sip and looked at her but she was looking out of the window and now sitting sideways.
He sighed and broke the silence.
"Thanks for the coffee", he said politely, "you're going to explain what you did 
back there right?".
Betty nodded but still said nothing.
"I want it to come out right, OK? So just give me a minute", said Betty looking at
him and then back out the window. A moment later she turned to face him squarely
but with her knees drawn up in front of her and her arms wrapped around them.
"Steve, you remember what I said the other night don't you? I love you, I want to
marry you and I want to have a family with you. That is totally clear, OK. Are we
clear on that?" asked Betty.
"Yes", replied Steve.
"You believe me right? No doubt in your mind?" asked Betty again.
"Well, yes and no. Yes that I don't think you're lying but the fact that you just 
changed the date of the wedding does give some grounds for doubt. You know I'm
paranoid about these things and until that ring finally goes on that finger I 
will still feel that." confessed Steve.
"OK, but you saw that I didn't cancel, only postponed. I'm not running away only
deferring. You get that right?", asked Betty needing to be sure of Steve's side
before proceeding any further.
"I get that you did that but not why", answered Steve.
It was clear that no amount of reassurance was going to dislodge his paranoia.
"OK, well, I've told you I want to marry you and I've told you that I will and I
guess there isn't any mor assurances I can give you. You just have to trust that
I'll be there when the day comes. But I'm making you a promise on that and I hope
that will be enough for you". Betty made the same point again to see if it had
gone through.
"Right. OK. You've made me a promise. You can do no more I guess." He nodded to
himself and Betty could see that the penny had dropped. Now it was time to explain
why.
"I'll now tell you why", said Betty, "because I'm a mess. I still need time to get
over Anne's death and this shit at work is driving me crazy. All this infighting
and trying to save face. I wish I could just walk out of there and never go back."
Steve looked at her in amazement. He always thought that Betty loved her job and
that right now she was doing everything in her power to protect her place. This 
was the first time he had heard her say anything against it. As far as Betty was
concerned it was working. She needed to convince him that the reason for her 
need to postpone the wedding was ongoing grief and the pressure at work. Then the
cancer could be left out of it. She continued to explain about how factions had 
been formed and those who had been predicted to be on the firing list were indeed
fired. It was a hostile environment covered with cheesy grins. She told that was
one of the reasons why she was cautious about talking about the pregnancy as it
would be a mark against her. He began to realise that it wasn't really a problem
with her job but with the atmosphere there. It wasn't like that where he worked
even though cutbacks were happening there too. They were more supportive of each
other. Steve understood Betty's situation and also felt included in her world.

The next part he didn't like much. Instead of staying in New York Betty wanted
to leave town for a few days, perhaps a week. She just needed a change of scene
and away from her whole life. Everything. But just for a little while. With more
reassurances and explanations Steve finally understood Betty's reasons but he 
still didn't like her going away. He even thought of taking time off to go with
her. But he didn't.

Betty was going to see her friend Trudy. Trudy was an old friend from her college 
days who now lived on the other side of the country in Santa Rosa, California. 
They were still in touch and contacted each other for long chats during times of
crisis. The last time was when Trudy's husband died. But as they lived so far
apart it was a friendship that existed over the phone. This would be the first
time they had met since their university days. It wasn't so much a promise as
a condition that happened to arise quite naturally that they were there for 
each other. She phoned Trudy and asked if she could come over and stay with
her for a few days. Trudy agreed immediately and guessed that the crisis must
be of magnitude that demanded a visit in person. But they were also looking 
forward to seeing each other.

There was one more thing that Steve didn't like and that was the fact that Betty
had decided to drive from New York to Santa Rosa. It was ill-advised to travel
by air at the moment due to the long queues and delays but there weren't any
problems with the trains. Or so Steve had argued. But Betty's counter was that
there were delays on the trains too. At least with a car you were in control 
but the journey time would be longer. Steve was exasperated and just put up his
hands in despair. First she changed the wedding day, then she wanted to take a
break out of town and now she wanted to drive the full width of the United 
States. To him it was all plain crazy and perhaps it still wouldn't have made
any sense to him had he known that she had cancer. But she was dealing with it
in her own way. Driving would give her time on her own. She wouldn't really 
have this kind of solitude on the train. Time to think, time to reflect and 
time to just enjoy being on her own. Something she had experienced a few weeks
ago and she needed more of it.

After an uncomfortable weekend with Steve who failed to understand Betty's 
reasoning, she was back at work the following Monday. It was just as cutthroat
as it had been the week before. She was scared to even ask about time off. She
managed to get a few minutes with one of her bosses and asked. He suggested that
she delegate some of her tasks before she left but other than that she got no
indication that there was any danger of her losing her job. But that was the
charade. She spent the following day, Tuesday organising her tasks so that her
workload could be handled by her colleagues. They accepted them with a friendly
smile which was a relief to her but they knew that they were now in with a 
chance of ousting her and that meant more chance of keeping their own jobs. She
had already taken two weeks leave only a month ago and now she was taking ten
days. She knew she was playing a dangerous game but she had to do it. She would
leave on Wednesday and drive across America and she was hoping that after a few
days with Trudy she would figure things out.
*********************************************************************************
Betty drummed her fingers on the counter top while the sales assistant took away
her license and credit card meaning to return with her car keys. It wasn't that
she was frustrated or impatient but just a habit that she had. Often she wasn't 
even aware that she was doing it. The assistant at Hertz in Jersey City returned
with her keys for a Volvo S80 family saloon. He handed her the documents along 
with her credit card and license. She had rented cars before but not for such a
long journey so she wanted to make sure that this one was fit for purpose. Not
too flash but smooth and easy to drive. The assistant shook hands with her and
wished her a pleasant journey.

It was only a month after her sister's death and her family had urged her to 
stay and have her wedding but due to the recent news that she had received she
could no longer remain within the confines of her family and friends. Steve had
found it very hard but consented after being reassured that she was coming back.
She had been away on business trips before so what was the big deal? But to him
it didn't feel right. Gaining their consent to take a break was only the first 
step, convincing them that she needed to drive there was another thing entirely.
Being a lawyer though she was able to list enough good arguments get them to 
shrug and nod.

As the crow flies the trip would be around forty hours or more but she wanted a
relaxing trip. The drive was going to be part of the break rather than just a 
journey. She wasn't going to drive through the night but stay at motels and 
get a good nights sleep between each days drive. Take in a little tourism here
and there and generally be with herself. No work, no family, no friends and no
fiancee. Would that make her vulnerable? Probably not. She had a pretty tough 
exterior.

Having removed her suitcases from her own car she placed them into the boot of
her rented Volvo and placed her handbag on the passenger seat. She got a feel
of the controls and nosed it out of the parking bay toward the Pulaski Skyway
which would take her through Newark and the I78 to Harrisburg and then I76 to
Pittsburgh. Then the I70 to Columbus. She could probably make that by the end
of the day at an easy pace especially as it was still early. She was thinking
that it would take four full days of driving without pushing herself too 
hard. It was nice to finally let go and relax. Or so she thought for it was 
far from relaxing. 

So much to think about and so many miles to think about it. Sunglasses, cruise
control and whatever local radio station she happened to passing. She wanted to
feel part of wherever she was. There was a lot of traffic on the roads but it
was all flowing quite freely. She gripped the steering wheel gently and let
the car do the work as she merely nudged it now and again. 

Gradually her thoughts began to drift away from the practicalities to all that 
she was holding back. Her sister only dead one month, the Al Quaeda attacks, 
her family and fiancee missing her and of course the breast cancer. One of 
these events would have been enough for anyone but she had to deal with them 
all at the same time. She couldn't of course, she needed help and that was why
she was going to see Trudy. But it wasn't like her. She rose to the challenge
and faced whatever needed to be faced. But her world was falling apart, quite
literally. Some would have simply curled up and died and even though she didn't
want to admit it she had felt like that a few times. That had scared her. It 
wasn't like her but then all the recent events weren't familiar ones either.

She recalled war stories her grandfather had recounted where buildings had been
reduced to rubble and close friends had died. But they just had to move on for
their own survival. Those stories suddenly came alive and no longer seemed to
her like old people talking about the war. They had hoped that their children 
would never have to experience such destruction but there it was happening to
her.

Betty couldn't really focus on any particular sets of feelings. They were all
a mish-mash of random sensations that bubbled to the surface and waved for a 
little while till they sank under again. Flashes of times spent playing with
her sister, of the early days with Steve and the very recent ones. Her folks
pleading with her to stay and be part of the family and to see this thing 
through together. They had just lost a daughter and wanted to be with the
one that still remained. Her boss telling her that she could take as long as
she needed but wondering if that meant he thought that she was weak. But the
thought that kept returning over and over again was the mammogram and the sound
of the doctor's voice as he handed her the results. In her imagination she 
could hear only the sound but not the words. As though she had water in her
ears or earplugs. There was too much background noise amongst the mass of 
thoughts and emotions to really focus on any particular scene.

Just after Harrisburg she took a pit stop. She leafed through the literature
from the doctor but seemed to be staring at the page rather than reading it.
Was it really true? Was this her? Was she just reading an article in the 
newspaper? She sipped her coffee through the little opening in the cover of 
the cup. She looked at the papers again and the x-ray print. It was starting
to sink in. She could feel something inside. Some sort of sensation that felt
somewhat alien. A slight dizziness and a momentary blur in her vision. A good
thing she wasn't driving at the time. She didn't really know what it was but
decided to allow it to work itself through rather than try to suppress. It 
could come back when she was driving. She wasn't a psychologist but she did
believe in the subconscious mind and guessed that this was something coming up
from there and that who we are and how we are all comes from that place that
most people refer to as the subconscious mind. It was probably the best 
strategy. If she got the shakes while she was driving or started to get blurry
vision then it could be fatal. She didn't want to die like that. She took one
more sip of coffee and pretended that everything was fine. She didn't really
want to have any interactions or people asking her if she was OK.

Back in car she felt like she wanted to move. Energy from the coffee perhaps 
or just feeling a little ashamed at having felt something that showed that she
was weak. But it was time to put her foot down and start going a little faster.
She stuck to route 76 and drove for 2 hours straight. A bit faster than she had
anticipated but having done a little looking within herself she decided that 
she needed to get back to the real world for a while. A dead sister, a wedding
on hold and possibly not long to live. A lot to process. One thing at a time.
Pittsburgh wasn't too far away, probably another hour or so. But she could 
feel another tremor coming. It seemed bigger this time. Time for another short
stop.

Not a long stop this time. A small car park with a couple of picnic benches and
a sign with details about the local area and walking routes. But there were
toilets and a rubbish bin. She used the toilet and sat for a while breathing
deeply. Something was happening and she sensed that it was better not to fight
it. She imagined how this would have looked if it had happened on the plane.
Death. It was death. He sister had died and now it was her turn. How long did
she have? She didn't really want to think about it but the thoughts and feelings
kept pushing their way to the front of the crowd. She didn't like the way it 
was going but she felt good about the way she was dealing with it. It was like
she was leaking and if she could hold out long enough to get to Trudy's place
then she would be fine. She knew all about feelings and emotions and how to 
deal with what drives us from deep down.

A light snack in the car before hitting the road again. Radio on loud with some
upbeat pop music and onward to Columbus. She was in a driving mood and didn't 
want to go into Pittsburgh and changed from route 76 to route 70. This would 
take her all the way there. She had taken it easy earlier in the day so it was
already early evening but she wanted to push on before finding a motel and 
Columbus seemed like a good target for that day. She wanted to call Trudy about
what had happened that day but as they were 2 hours ahead on the West Coast she
thought that perhaps she shouldn't disturb her. An urgent toilet break caused
her to stop again. She didn't really want to especially as it was dark but she
really couldn't hold it much longer. She was getting low on fuel anyway. 
Columbus was very close but she was close to wetting her pants. A small garage
in Buckeye Lake. Then refreshed she continued on to Columbus arriving only a 
few minutes later. She drove to the West side of town before finding a motel.

There were plenty of rooms and it was just off the freeway so it would easy to
get going again in the morning. She took her cases into the room and lay down
on the bed with her arms out wide. It was only 10pm and that was midnight in
California. Maybe Trudy was still awake? She took off her shoes and turned on
the heating. It was some rickety thing on the wall with many layers of paint.
She rubbed her hands together as the unit got up to speed. She stood with her
back to it and closed her eyes to enjoy the full effect of the warmth. Shower,
that's what she wanted. But she knew that once she got in there she wasn't 
going to get out for a while. She decided to try Trudy first.

She used the motel room phone and put her mobile phone on charge. She had 
changed out of her jeans into her pyjama bottoms to help her wind down after
her long drive. She found some menus distributed on the table top and phoned
for a pizza. Pepperoni with salad and coke. Keep it simple. That way it might
arrive a little faster. After snacking all day she could feel the hunger.

She called Trudy. Trudy answered. 
"Sorry to call so late. You about to go to bed?", asked Betty.
"No, not yet. I'm a bit of a night bird so it's ok if you want to talk."
Trudy was tired but she was trying to be accommodating.
"It won't be a long one as I've only just arrived and haven't showered yet."
"Eww. I'm glad I'm not in that room with you", teased Trudy.
"What do you mean?", asked Betty chuckling.
"Oh, fragrant flowers I'm sure. So where are you?" asked Trudy.
"I'm in Columbus, Ohio. Not bad for a day's drive. I was planning on taking it
a bit slower but hey, I got in the mood so I went with it."
"That is good going. How's the motel?"
"It's ok. It's cheap and it's clean and the heating works."
There was a knock at the door. That was quick she thought. 
"Hang on Trudy that's probably my pizza delivery. Be right back."
She reached for her purse and went to the door. 
"Miss Klein? Pepperoni and a salad?" asked the delivery man.
"Yes, that's correct."
"Seven bucks eighty maam."
She paid and closed the door and went straight back to the phone. She opened the
coke and took a sip. 
"Sorry about that. I'm so hungry. Didn't hit me all day but now I can really feel
it."
"What you got?"
"Pepperoni and salad. Do you mind if I eat while we talk?"
"Sure. Bon appetit."
The pizza was already sliced so she pulled out a wedge and took a big bite and 
then another sip of coke. She couldn't find any napkins so she wiped her hand on
the motel towel. I'm paying for this she thought. She took another big bite but
chewed it quickly as she was aware that Trudy was on the other end of the line.
"So what's on your mind? You didn't call just to tell me about the motel. Did 
something happen?"
Betty took another swallow before she answered.
"I was looking at the papers I got from the doctor and I got all dizzy and shaky.
I felt a bit faint and you know like a mild sense of panic."
"What did you do?"
"Nothing really. I just sort of let it happen. I figured that it was better to
let it happen at a pit stop rather than while I was driving and that it could
happen again if I didn't let it out."
"Good plan. So what was this paper you got from the doctor?"
"I don't want to talk about that right now. I'll tell you when I get there."
"OK".
"But it happpend again later on and it was stronger. I mean I really think I 
would have crashed the car".
"Oh god. You OK?"
"I'm fine. Now that I'm in my room and warm and with my dinner."
"Look, why don't you take the train the rest of the way?"
"Can you imagine how it would feel to be going through that and have strangers
around you?"
"Yeah, I guess. Well, take it easy anyway. And maybe don't look at those papers
till you get here. Whatever they are."
"OK. That sounds sensible."
"I'll have a good night's sleep and hopefully should be fine tomorrow. They were
against me driving. And this is the first time I've had a break so it could be 
that."
"Flying probably wouldn't have been quicker especially with all these security 
checks going on right now. I bet they're pissed at you for missing Thanksgiving
too."
"I told them I'd be back by then."
"Yeah right. That's really going to happen."
"You're right."
"Um. I am feeling a little tired actually. It's coming up to one am now. I have
client in the morning."
"Ok, no problem. Thanks for listening."
"Sure, anytime. I'm available during the day too. So call me if you get any more
of those little episodes, OK."
"Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow."
"Well. I wish you a very good night Betty."
"Goodnight Trudy."
Betty put down the phone and saw that there was more than half her pizza remaining
and it was getting cold. She was still hungry though so she worked her way through
it. Wolfed down the salad and the rest of the coke. She hadn't finished chewing
the last mouthful before she headed for the bathroom and turned on the shower. A 
powerful stream of very hot water. Just what she wanted and what she needed. She 
stayed in there for a long time and the water stayed as hot and as powerful as 
it had began. When she got out she could feel the drowsiness hitting her and she
didn't try and fight it. Before long it was lights out.

She did have a good night's sleep and tried to grab a hold of fragments of 
dreams but they slipped away. She hadn't set her alarm but she was up at 6.30
and even though that was only five and a half hours she felt quite fresh and
awake. She got dressed, put the cases in the car and handed back her motel key.
Time to hit the road. She looked at the map and realised that she had only 
travelled about a quarter of the distance. At this rate she would be spending
more time on the road than with Trudy. She resolved to make good progress and
cover a substantial distance. Kansas City. She put her finger down firmly on
the map. It would be a full day's drive with hardly any breaks but it was 
possible. She felt more confident today and the episodes from the previous day
seemed as though they had happened in the distant past.

It was a clear day without a cloud in the sky. She put the car into drive and 
nosed out of the motel parking and made her way to the I70 again. She would 
just need to remain on the same road to take her all the way to Kansas City.
No junctions, no intersections, no turns. Easy. She was planning to stop for
snacks, coffee and toilet of course but no long breaks. She figured that with
the cruise control and open roads the whole thing would be a bit of a break.
Yesterday had been a tough day but that was the first and a kind of breaking
in day. Today would be easier. She could feel it. The radio was on and she had
a few mini doughnuts from the previous day. A little on the dry side but still
pretty tasty. Indianapolis was the next stop. With the cruise control she was
feeling confident enough today to take off her shoes and put her feet up on
the seat and cross her legs. Kind of dangerous so it was a bold move. But it
did show that she felt on top of things. She sang along to the radio and made
some subtle dance movements while she kept her hands on the wheel. She didn't
bother changing lane or overtaking as there weren't many others on the road.

Indianapolis. She stopped for around 20 minutes. Long enough to fill up the
car, get coffee, use the toilet and stock up on a few snacks. She bought enough
to see her through the day in case she had to stop somewhere that was busy or
if she just didn't really want to stop for very long. She smiled to herself
that she was doing well and got back in the car for the next leg. Same drill,
radio, cruise control and feet up on the seat. The radio wasn't so good this
time and there was a bit more traffic. This slightly grated on her but it
didn't last for long. And the music improved too, at least to her taste. She
had held out without a smoke for a good long while so it was time to light up.
A smoker is always a smoker even when they don't smoke however long that may 
last. This required a stop though as she didn't want to smoke out the hire
car and she didn't like the smell of stale smoke. She stopped at a picnic
table a little way after Effingham with St. Louis only a short distance away.
She was one of those smokers who were able to cut back quite easily without the
least bit of effort. But just like most smokers that wouldn't last too long.
The yearning would return soon enough. She admired the scenery and watched the
cars drive both ways. So many shapes and sizes. Where were they all going? Were
there any that were going exactly the same way? Perhaps even the same 
destination. It was possible. Her head began to spin a little and she waited it
out. Her hands trembled a little but she put it down to the nicotine. She 
imagined some pain around her left breast but it was only her imagination.

With her break over she sped on towards St. Louis. It wasn't too long before
she arrived. She had a craving for a fizzy carbonated drink so she bought one.
A big one in a tall cup with a straw so it would easy to drink while driving.
She stopped for a slightly longer time at St. Louis just to stretch a little
and move around. She didn't want a big meal but made herself eat something a 
bit more substantial than the little snacks she had gathered earlier that day.
It wasn't physically demanding as such but she figured that proper nutrition 
was always a good idea. The long break was only a fraction more than her 
cigarette break and she wondered whether she should push on beyond Kansas city
as she was making such good progress. Her mood could change the following day
or there could be traffic. Strike while the iron was hot. She pushed on and 
when she got to Kansas City it was already starting to get darker but just at
the point where one might turn on the lights. Driving a Volvo her lights were
permanently on so she didn't even need to consider it. Her current plan was
to keep going till she was tired or bored. It could mean having to stay in a
motel in a small town but she was feeling game so she continued. Through 
Kansas City and Topeka to the West of it. Straight through Junction City and
Abilene. Was she going to continue to Denver? She got to Salina and got out
for a cigarette. At a small roadside diner she got coffee and flicked through
a newspaper that someone had left. People outside of New York weren't so 
affected by the attacks on the World Trade Center and for them their small
towns were their whole world. This was one of the main reasons she didn't want
to stop in these places. She finished her cheesecake and gulped down her last
mouthful of coffee. She was starting to feel tired in spite of the caffeine.
Should she keep driving or should she call it a day and find somewhere to sleep?

Back on the road she felt awake. The roads were quiet and it was only late 
evening and not even the early hours. She didn't want to admit it to herself
but perhaps she could make it to Denver. But wouldn't that cut into the next
day? Wouldn't that mean getting up late and missing the morning? Didn't matter
she was on holiday now. No obligation to conform to any routine. Denver it was
then. Same old I70 and she clung to it like a mollusc. She could have gone on
all night but 3.00 am was far enough. She'd made it to Denver and Betty decided
to stop and take a rest. She drove through the city and made her way to the West
side as that would have been much slower during the day time. She found a motel
in the Lakewood area and hit the hay. No shower, no brushing of teeth or putting
on her pyjamas. T-shirt and panties. She got up a moment later to check that the
door was properly closed but then sleep took over and she didn't stir again till
after 10.00 am the following morning.

She could easily have slept longer. Caffeine keeps you up the night before but
makes you drowsy on the morning after. So she needed more. She could rest all 
she needed in the car so after a quick shower she was back in the car for the 
third day. Only about a quarter of a tank but plenty of snacks. She sipped on 
the drink that was pretty flat by now. Sickly sweet. She sipped it anyway. Gave
her a road feeling. A few mouthfuls of crisps, not ideal breakfast food but it
gave her the boost she needed. Lethargy could be just around the corner if she
wasn't careful. It was possible to make it all the way today and she wanted to
keep her head together rather than need another day. She was sort of enjoying
her trip but she was also yearning to see her friend try to make sense of 
what was happening to her.

She headed North on the I25 to Cheyenne and then West on the I80 towards Salt
Lake City. She could have taken the 40 and got to see the forests but better
to be on a bigger and straighter road. Especially going long distance like 
this. It still offered some great views but she was starting to get bored of
the scenery and generally irritable. Feeling a little restless as well she was
in need of something to do. No more feet on the seat. She decided to push the 
speed but not too much. No sense in getting a fine.

There were some short rain showers but nothing major. With just a couple of 
short stops she pushed on to Salt Lake City. The road was pretty clear and she
didn't have any more episodes. That was quite a relief. That made her feel a 
bit more confident and less anxious about having an accident. It was early 
afternoon by the time she was passing through Salt Lake City. She didn't stop
for long, only to take a late lunch. Today she was hungry and went for a full
spread at a roadside diner: burger, fries and salad. That ought to keep her
going. It did make her feel a little drowsy but nothing a cup of coffee could
not solve.

She stayed on the I80 and drove on to Reno. A little rush hour traffic but no
major jams. After Reno it was the Tahoe National Forest by which time it was
starting to get dark. She was wondering about stopping at another motel but
it wasn't too far now. But suddenly the tiredness hit her. It was as though
her body had been holding out all this time and now it couldn't wait any 
longer. She stopped for a break at Sacramento and called Trudy. 
"Hi Trudy, it's Betty. I'm in Sacramento. It's pretty late already so I'm like
wondering if I should get a room and come over in the morning?"
"Betty, I don't mind, really. You can come late. But how're you feeling? I mean
you've been driving all day. Maybe you could do with a rest?"
"I'm OK. Sure, I'm a little tired but it's only a couple more hours or so".
"Well, if you think you're up to it. Don't worry about waking me if I do fall
asleep."
"Shit, I feel bad now. OK, I'll get a room. I can see me getting lost and 
falling asleep at the wheel."
"That wouldn't be good at all. OK, you get a good night's rest and I'll see 
you in the morning."
"OK. I'm really looking forward to it."
"Bye Betty".
"See you tomorrow".
She put down the phone and sighed. Betty was so looking forward to seeing Trudy
this evening. It was what had kept her going. It was boring but it was a very
sensible thing to do. She found a motel just off the Harbor Boulevard and got
into bed fairly quickly. After her big lunch she wasn't too hungry so she just
nibbled on some of the snacks that she had left over in the car. It was starting
to look a little messy in there. She wanted to make an early start so she cleared
it out and asked for a wake up call. They would also provide coffee and doughnuts.
She thought about phoning Trudy again but better just to get to sleep and see her
in person which after all was the reason for this trip.
*********************************************************************************
After three days on the road across the USA Betty finally arrived at Trudy's 
place. It didn't take her long to drive from Sacramento to Santa Rosa but then
it was tricky route from there to Trudy's house. Her house was almost on the 
beach, a wooden house with one storey which resembled a dilapided shack from a
distance. Betty had to drive her car right to end of the tarmaced road to reach
Trudy's house. She was a little worried about the rental car. It felt to remote
even though Santa Rosa was only a few minutes drive away. It was around 11.00 
when Betty arrived and Trudy was sitting out on the porch with mug of hisbiscus
tea looking out to sea. She was wearing a thick woolen sweater and holding the 
cup in the ends of the sleeves. Trudy had freckles and very long strawberry
blond hair that was nearly always tied up in a plait. She turned when she heard
the car approaching and put her tea down onto the wooden table. Betty hadn't 
described the car to her so she waited till she could see the driver. They had
always remained in contact since they were at uni together but they hadn't 
sent each other photos. Letters and phonecalls are one thing but meeting in 
person can be quite an eye opener. Trudy recognised Betty at once. She smiled
as though this visit had happened many times before and started to walk towards
the car.

Trudy was wearing tight black legging with grey stripes and walking boots. She
was almost stomping across the sandy soil towards Betty. Betty stopped the car
and sat there looking at Trudy walking towards her. Betty had more trouble 
recognising Trudy than Trudy did of Betty. She was not how she had remembered
her. Her face looked familiar but her style had changed a great deal. It was 
as though someone had dressed up to look like Trudy or someone who looked like
Trudy had dressed in their own way. While Betty thought this over Trudy had 
arrived at the car and was knocking at the drivers door window. Betty started
to open the door and Trudy helped her pull it all the way open. Betty got out
and they just hugged. A long easy hug that said all they could have said by
way of greeting. As they pulled apart Betty caught hold of Trudy's plait and
examined it.
"Wow, that's quite something. How long is it? I mean in years."
Trudy wasn't going to be starting a conversation right there next to the car.
She took it as a rhetorical question and asked Betty to get her bags and then 
go inside. Trudy helped with the bags and they trudged under the weight of the
luggage over to the beach house. When they were inside Betty was still worried
about the hire car.
"Is my car going to OK here? Well, actually it's not my car it belongs to Hertz
which is all the more reason for me to be extra careful."
"It'll be fine. You see some couples, some joggers and dog walkers of course.
But it's unlikely that someone would come here to steal a car or cause any
damage. It's safe. Don't worry."
As a way to reassure her further Trudy showed Betty to the room where she'd be
staying and through the window she would be able to see the car. The other 
window looked out to sea which is the one that would prove to be more important
once felt more comfortable there.

Once Betty's luggage was inside she and Trudy went into the kitchen and waited
for the water to boil. Betty opted for coffee while Trudy had another cup of 
hibiscus tea. They walked out onto the porch where there were large bamboo 
armchairs with dirty looking white cushions. As Betty was looking for somewhere
to set down her coffee she felt something pressing against her from behind. She
imagined it might be some kind of furniture and turned to see what it was. She
jumped a little and put her hand to her heart when she realised what it was. 
Trudy giggled when she saw what had happened. 
"This is Benjy", said Trudy, "he's harmless and sleeps most of the time. We go
for a little walk once a day. That's his spot right there".
She pointed to his rug. He was big shaggy Red Setter more of a copper than a red
and extremely calm. Having greeted Betty he promptly found his way to his rug 
and sat down to look out to sea and occassionally turning to look at Betty.
"So, here you are at last", said Trudy.
"Here I am", said Betty.
"Gosh, how long has it been?"
"Too long. Sure is good to see you."
They sat down properly and got comfortable. Trudy moved the table a little so 
that they could both reach it easily. They each took a sip of their hot drink
looked at each other and smiled. The sun was well up in the sky as it was mid-
morning but it was still hazy. Some sea mist still around and along with a slight
wind the sound of sea birds. Betty snuggled deeper into her armchair: she had
arrived and it was time to relax. She flicked the lock of hair that was coming
across her face and took another sip of her coffee.
"I can't believe your hair - it's so long. Has it been growing all this time?"
Betty wanted to launch into stuff that was going on with her but she didn't want
to seem rude or selfish. But there was a strong yearning to let it all out.
Trudy laughed because she could see Betty was fidgeting and aching to talk about
her life and what was meaningful to her.
"What's funny? asked Betty looking around.
"You are." laughed Trudy "I'm sorry, but you drove out all this way just to talk
about my hair? Betty, come on, it's me. You don't need to that small talk shit.
Just let it out. You're here now and I'm listening. Tell me everything".
Betty was stunned and opened her eyed wide. She made a shy smile.
"Am I that easy to read?" asked Betty.
"Uh huh", nodded Trudy. "But just give me the highlights for now as I've got a
client coming in half an hour or so."
"Client?" asked Betty knitting her brows.
"Oh, didn't I tell you? I do massage. Well it's kind of a massage. It's called
Shiatsu and I do acupuncture treatments too. Gotta pay the rent." She said with
a turn of the head.
"This guy is a long term client, he's been coming for about three years I guess.
He was in a car accident and was OK in terms of injuries, I mean nothing too 
serious but he was reliving it all over again. Like having nightmares and visions
and all that shit. Doctor gave him drugs but that kind of made things worse in a
way. He said the pills just made everything feel flat. I mean his nightmares all
stopped but he didn't feel anything at all. Just no ups and downs. Must be so 
many people going through the same shit. Anyway, someone recommended me to him
and he came along to give it a try and three years later he's still coming. He's
fairly well off and has a busy job so he often cancels last minute but still pays
me, which is cool."
"So you didn't do anything with your degree?" asked Betty.
"I did for a while, you know, same as you but uh, things changed. California 
being what it is and all the alternative lifestyles that we follow here. It was
easy to be influenced by that. I was going to yoga classes and one of my friends
there was having acupuncture treatment so I thought I'd give it a try. After Gary
died it was pretty tough being here on my own."
"Right. How long ago was that?" asked Betty.
"About five years ago I guess. Yeah. But soon after that I was hooked to this 
treatment. I mean totally. Like I was back at college all over again. I suppose
that after Gary was gone I needed something to put myself into, something that
was wholesome and nourishing. It's been amazing. I'm doing something that I love
doing and I have this great lifestyle. I was a little scared at first being here
on my own but I feel much better now."
"Wow, that's amazing. I want to know more about it. I mean I've just been 
wondering where my own life is going and you're just so ahead of me on that
score." Betty seemed in awe of Trudy's life.
"It's taken a while but I've had some great support out here. I've got my yoga
and meditation group, my acupucture friends and my Taekwondo friends". 
"Taekwondo?", asked Betty, "what, you do martial arts too? You're like totally
Eastern mystic. You've turned into a hippy".
"Well, yes and no. It wasn't like I got membership to the hippy club or anything
like that. And I'm still very skeptical about a lot of that pseudo esoteric stuff
that some of the people talk but what I've explored so far is entirely based on
my own experience. The acupunture gave me my energy back and the Taekwondo gave 
me my confidence back. I didn't swallow any doctines you know, I tried stuff out
and have kept the things that worked." Trudy didn't mind being called a hippy 
but she didn't like the idea of everything alternative being dumped into that
category. Betty stopped being sarcastic and nodded in agreement. Then she 
shrugged.
"Sorry, I didn't mean it that way." said Betty.
"I know, I was the same. And I wouldn't call myself a hippy but from where you're
sitting I look like a hippy by anyones standards. But hey, I'm in California so
I can be as hippy as I want." She said smiling.
"Well, good for you". Said Betty.
The phone rang and Trudy got up to go and answer it. She came back a minute later.
"He's cancelled so I'm free for the rest of the day. What shall we do? You hungry?
You want to grab a bite some place?" asked Trudy.
"Sure", nodded Betty.
"I know a place that does great seafood just a little way along the beach. I feel
like a walk. How about we take Benjy and take a stroll along the beach?"
"Sounds great. I wanna hear more about your life. It's so different to anyone I 
know in New York." Betty had almost forgotten about her own troubles and why she
had gone there in the first place. 
"You need to get changed or are you ready like that?" asked Trudy eager to get
going.
"I'm good. I just need to get my purse." Betty jumped out of her seat and went
into her new room for a moment. She looked at the room for a moment and let her
eyes rest on some of the ornaments. There was a windchime and a dreamcatcher.
"OK, I'm ready", said Betty, raising her hands. Trudy took the dog lead from its
hook and Benjy got up immediately and shook himself and stretched. Trudy put the
lead on his collar and locked the door. They walked on to the beach and close to
the shore where the sand was a bit firmer. A little further along their route 
she let Benjy off the lead and he ran on ahead chasing the birds. Trudy grabbed
a piece of driftwood and threw it. He ran after it and returned with it in his
mouth. Trudy patted his head and threw the wood again. This time it was lost in
the surf. He snuffled around for it but it was washed away. He didn't really 
want to get wet so didn't follow it into the sea to try and retrieve it. He was
happy just to run alongside them as they continued to stroll. 

The sound of the sea was very calming along with the space. They could see the
horizon and the bay stretched back a long way from the shore giving a sense of
open space. There were some people jogging and there was a small group fishing
but otherwise the beach was deserted. Betty took a deep breath and found herself
settling into what would be her life for the next couple of weeks.
"So tell me about this Thai kun do", said Betty, "is it like Kung Fu or something?
I saw Bruce Lee does something called Jeet Kune do. Is is like that?"
"It's Taekwondo." corrected Trudy, "No, not Kung Fu. It's more like Karate but 
has more kicking. I did try some other ones but I liked this one the best."
She was sad thinking about Gary and how he died.
"I've been training pretty hard so I'll be doing that a couple of times a week.
You can come along if you like", suggested Trudy encouragingly.
"What and get my ass whipped", said Betty.
"It's not like that", chuckled Trudy, "if the sensei beat up all the new people 
he'd have a pretty small class you know."
"But I've never done it before. Can I just watch?", asked Betty.
"They don't like people watching. You can just join the beginners group. Lots of
moms and kids there too."
"Great, I'll get beat up by a kid".
"Come on Betty, it'll be fun. But if you really don't want to come that's cool.
You can hang here or whatever really. But you'll get to see it first hand."
"OK, I'll give it a shot." said Betty reluctantly. Trudy laughed again and put
her arm through Bettys. They walked a little faster.
"So when are going to tell me what's going on? Why all the mystery?", said Trudy.
"I guess I'm not really sure what's going on. I have an idea but I just needed
some time to think about it and get away from my normal life."
"OK. You guys in New York were hit pretty hard with the Trade Center attacks and
your sister died. I was real sorry to hear that. But you're about to get married.
I mean doesn't that kind of balance things? Like, lots of shit has happened but
now you got something real nice coming up. So my guess is that whatever this 
thing might be is not a good thing. I'm guessing it's another shitty thing that's
hit you pretty hard and it's just one too many. Am I right?" said Trudy.
She felt Betty's arm tighten against hers and turned towards her to see the tears
flooding down her face. They stopped walking and Betty let go of the deepest most
guttaral sobs she had cried. Something inside of her told her that it was a safe
place and she could finally be totally open. She let go of Trudy's arm and feel
to her knees. Her movements were convulsive and all Trudy could do was reach down
and stroke her back. She didn't try and stop her or say anything or try and lift
her up but allowed her the time she needed to experience her cathartic tears.
Betty couldn't remember ever crying like that. It was long and intense and without
reserve. When the spell had passed she came to her senses and found herself 
kneeling on the sand and looking around her. For a moment she didn't know where
she was and just looked out to sea. Then she remembered. She felt a little 
embarrased and wiped her tears with her sleeve. She looked up and let Trudy help
her up.
"Oh god, I'm really sorry. I really wasn't expecting that. I don't think I've ever
cried like that. Shit. That was intense", she said trying to make light of it.
"I was right wasn't I? You got the mob after you?" she asked squinting.
Betty laughed out loud and threw back her head. She took Trudy's arm again and 
they continued to walk and soon came upon a small harbour with a few boats and
lots of birds flying around. They joined a path that lead away from the shoreline
towards the harbour. There was a building with flaking red paint and very large
windows. It had tables outside which weren't occupied and some occupied tables
inside. This was Captain Joe's seafood diner. It was like a typical diner but 
they specialised in seafood dishes. 
"Hey Joe, got my friend Betty visiting. Can we get a couple of platters. How you
doin'?" said Trudy as she opened the door for Betty.
"Hey Trudy," said Joe a skinny grey haired old man dressed in an apron and chef's
hat. "You guys want drinks?".
"A coke" said Trudy glancing at Betty who nodded," make that two".
They found a table by a window and Benjy curled up under the table.
"You're gonna love this place", said Trudy,"I don't come here all the time but
pretty often. It's not too expensive and the food is always great. Really fresh
and unadulterated. So, it's pretty big then whatever it is."
"Yeah, I guess it is."
"Well, you tell me when you're good and ready. No pressure. But I'm here for you.
You know that right. That's why you came." Trudy reached out and pressed Betty's
arm.
It wasn't long before their platters arrived. Big plates laden with a mix of all
the local seafoods. Joe served them himself to come and say hello to Betty. He
went through and explained each of the items on the plate and invited Betty to 
come at anytime. As Joe left the table Betty reached for a battered prawn and 
dipped it in the sauce. The firm texture of the meat coupled with the tartness
of the sauce made sense to her palette and she chewed slowly to savour the 
experience.
"Huh? What did I tell you." said Trudy congratulating herself.
Betty nodded in agreement and reached for another one. Then some squid, mussels
and scallops. There were handmade fries to accompany the dish which they both
devoured within minutes.
"You want to hang here or shall we go back?" asked Trudy. Betty liked the peace
and tranquility of the place but she was ready to open her heart to Trudy and 
this wasn't the place to do it.
"This one's on me OK? No, no, no arguments." Trudy pushed back Betty's hand as 
she attempted to put down a note. She caught Joe's eye and waved a note and she
indicated that she was leaving it on the table. They got up to leave and Joe 
wished them goodbye and to come again. Betty liked him and imagined herself going
there again on her own. As they walked along the track back to the shoreline 
Betty finally opened her heart.
"Trudy, I went to the hospital at the end of last month and had a mammogram. I 
think I have breast cancer. This one, the left one. I don't believe it though.
I mean I'm young. People over 55 have it and it's extremely rare in women below
the age of 40. It's a big shock, it really is. And I really don't know what to
do. So I came to you. There, that's the story. I knew you'd be able to listen 
without any kind of bias, so I'm in your hands".
"If you want to put yourself in my hand then let me give you a massage. I can get
a pretty good idea of your energy that way. Let's allow the food to settle a bit
and I'll give you a treatment: no charge of course."
"Wow. Thanks. Sounds fantastic."

When they got back to the house they sat on the porch again for a little while.
Betty stared out to sea and Trudy went inside to prepare some more drinks. A few
minutes later they had resumed the postures that they had held before going to
Captain Joe's. Even Benjy was curled up in his rug. Betty told Trudy about her
trip to the hospital and seeing the x-ray photograph for the first time. She 
also told of how it had been difficult to leave with the wedding approaching and
Steve had just not understood why she had to leave and why she couldn't talk
about it. She also told Trudy about the week that she was compassionate leave
and the reflections about life that she had had and how she wondered if what she
wanted was really her own desires or those of the collective or society at large.
Trudy listened and understood. She had gone through the process of self 
questioning herself. She used to commute to San Francisco did a very similar 9-5
job which gave her a nice lifestyle but a lot of the time she felt like a leaf
that was blown about by the wind. But now it felt as though her life was her own
and she was living by her own terms. It was after Gary had died that she had 
reflected in the same way that Betty had reflected. The ideas were not something
that she had been reading about or had talked about with others but had simply 
arisen when the conditions had right. Right in this case meaning bereaved. Betty
wondered if it happened to everyone who was bereaved. Perhaps Eric was thinking
the same and perhaps her parents too. Probably not. It wasn't purely as a result
of being bereaved and having time off. The germ of the idea must have been there
and these events simply catalysed it. She believed that nobody in her circle of
family and friends would have understood these ideas and that she had been crazy
to even entertain them. As though they were taboo. She was the epitome of middle
class success and she was questioning the very nature of that success and whether
it was success at all. It might burst a few bubbles but only if they listened.
But Trudy was listening and she understood and luckily for her when she had gone
through this process she had been in California where there are plenty of people
who don't subscribe to the American dream of the 9-5, the house, the husband and
the 2.4 children. What you did, who you were and how you lived your life were
entirely your own choice. There was no magic formula and there was no tried and
tested method that was guaranteed to work. The only guarantee was that you were
going to die and Betty felt that more strongly than she had ever done in her life.

"OK, let's get you ready for your treatment," said Trudy.
"You sure? I thought we needed a longer gap after lunch."
"Nah, that's long enough and we'll have a few more minutes while we set up."
"OK, if you're sure. I'm ready as I'll ever be".
One of the rooms in the house was almost empty except for a massage table set up
at the centre of the room and some subtle decorations. There was a meditating 
buddha statue in one corner with a large bowl in front of it filled with rice. 
Stubs from incense sticks were in the bowl along with ash trails. There were some
candles on old wrought iron candlesticks and bamboo roller blinds set an ambient
tone to lighting. Next to the massage table was a smaller table with some needles
on it and tiny cones that were perhaps incense cones too. At the foot of the
table was a blanket and a roll of wide tissue paper. At the wall that was farthest
from the window there was a rolled up futon mattress.
"We're going to do needles first to help me literally pinpoint where the blockages
might be. Are you warm enough?" asked Trudy. She had done this so many times 
before that she changed from her friend to a therapist in the space of one phrase.
"Yeah, I think so." 
"OK, that's great. I'm going take a few details first. Just sit yourself up on
this table and we'll spend five minutes on your history and take it from there."
Betty sat up on the table and Trudy got a clipboard and put a client assessment
sheet onto it. She asked questions that Betty was happy to answer and wrote them
down on the sheet. Trudy then asked Betty to lie down and Trudy took her pulses.
She moved her fingers to different positions on the inside of her wrist and again
wrote a few things down. She explained that one of the pulses was very weak and
that meant one of her channels was blocked. She then explained that in order to
unblock that channel she was going put a thin needle into a very specific point
and leave it there for a time. Betty was a bit wary about the size of the needle.
When Trudy showed her the needles Betty was no longer worried. In fact there 
were a few needles. One was in her palm and one in her thumb. Then a couple in
her shoulder and one more in her neck. After Trudy had placed the needles she
spun them very gently. Even though they were thin Betty felt this very strongly
and there was a very perceptible electric charge running between the points 
where the needles had penetrated her. The one that was inserted into her palm
felt much thicker than the others. When that particular one had been inserted it
had seemed to her that a normal sized sewing needle had entered her hand. As she
lay on her back she could feel her whole arm getting warm. Trudy had covered the
rest of her body with the blanket and Betty wondered how long she would be lying
there. It was very relaxing though so she didn't mind at all. What was wrong with
her arm though? Why had she chosen that part of her body as opposed to any other
part. Perhaps it was all the driving and the right arm had done more work. With
an automatic car this was very unlikely. It had to have some other special hippy
reason that Betty would have explained to her later on. Trudy had already told
her about the energy channel that was blocked but she didn't believe that at all.
As she lay there she drifted in and out of sleep with intense vivid dreams each
time she re-entered that world. It was the same dream: of swimming in a calm sea
while the sun was setting. Only the sound of her strokes and birds in the far
distance. When she was in dreamland it was the sound of the dream birds and when
she was awake it was the sound of real sea birds.

When Trudy came into the room again the sound fully awoke Betty and as well as
the warmth in her right arm Betty could feel sensations in her left breast. It
wasn't pain or tightness but more like tingling, like pins and needles. She'd
never felt that in her breast before. She felt heavy as though she had slept for
a week. She could smell the incense in the room. Trudy walked up to the table
to see if she was awake. 
"How're you feeling?" asked Trudy.
"Like I've been asleep for a long time", said Betty, "Looks darker than before".
"It sure is. You slept for three hours straight" she said like a doctor talking
to her patient. 
"I'm going to check your pulses again", said Trudy. She moved over to Betty's
left hand and put her first two fingers again on the inside of her wrist.
"That's a lot better. Still a ways to go but already a massive improvement".
She began to gently remove the needles and put them onto a small tray. Betty felt
as though she was being uncorked. She helped Betty to sit upright on the table
and gave her a glass of water. Betty gulped it down quickly and handed the glass
back to her. 
"You wanna be alone for a while or you OK? A lot of people need a moment alone 
after their treatment. I got no-one booked so go ahead and take your time."
"I'm OK. Feel kind of hungry though". 
"Well, follow me to the kitchen then, I'm about to cook dinner."
Betty slid off the massage table and went into the kitchen with Trudy. She already
had ingredients laid out. Lots of fresh vegetables and cous cous. 
"Can I help with anything?" asked Betty. 
"No, you just sit down and tell me about your treatment." Trudy handed her another
glass of water. This time Betty sipped it.
"I had a dream while I was on the table. I was on a warm beach and the sun was
setting. I could hear the birds and I swam out towards the sun. I could feel the
water on my skin and I could hear the sound of my strokes. It was like I was 
trying to keep up with the sun. I could see it reflected on the water's surface
and the water was so clear and calm. It wasn't warm water but there was a subtle
mist rising from it like I was in the tub and watching candle light reflected on
it."
"And how did it feel?" asked Trudy.
"It felt good. I've been feeling so sad and confused and anxious and scared and
all of that was gone. I felt very peaceful. But as it was so real I couldn't tell
if I was awake or asleep." Betty started to remember her dream again.
"And how do you feel now?" asked Trudy again while slicing some cherry tomatoes.
"I still feel that calm. I mean all the other stuff is still there but it seems
far away. Like I left it all there in New York. But then I guess it's all waiting
for me when I go back."
"Not necessarily. I'm not sure what the sea represents but the image of the sun
setting is quite clear I guess. The end of something, like the end of the day.
And the start of the night. But you were swimming towards it like you didn't 
want to let go of the day. But anyway, I'm not much of a dream analyst. The main
thing is that you feel better."
"I feel a heck of a lot better," said Betty finishing her water.
"Well, this is almost ready." said Trudy putting a big bowl of cous cous salad
onto the table. She put down two forks and two plates and served. Betty was
waiting for the wine bottle to appear and Trudy filled her glass with water a
third time.
"No booze tonight, not after your treatment. We'll get a drink tomorrow OK."
Betty nodded and sipped her water.
"Well, dig in." said Trudy.
"Did I tell you that I was supposed to be getting married today?" asked Betty.
"Oh Lord. Girl, you got it bad", said Trudy shaking her head.
They both chuckled and continued with their meal.
*********************************************************************************

When Betty woke up the next morning she wasn't quite sure where she was. The 
past few days had been in motels so she looked out of the window to check on her
car. It was still there but she couldn't see any other cars. The decor of the 
room seemed very different to any motel in which she had stayed. Suddenly she
remembered. She looked at her watch. It read 7.12. She went out of her room and
looked to see if Trudy was up. She couldn't find her. Benjy was asleep on the 
porch but there was no sign of Trudy. Perhaps she had an early morning client.
She went to the door of the therapy room but could hear nothing and there was
no smell of incense. The door to Trudy's room was slightly open so she gently
swung it open a little further to see inside. She saw Trudy at the far end of
the room sitting upright with her eyes closed and motionless. Whatever she was
doing Betty didn't want to disturb her. She went back into her own room and 
quietly unpacked her running things and got changed. She quietly slipped out
of the door and started with a fast walk to warm up. The tide was out leaving
a trail of seaweed and shells just inside the shoreline. She stepped up the 
pace to one that was as fast as she could walk. She swung her arms to get her
shoulders warm. It was certainly warmer than New York there but at that time
in the morning it still felt chilly. The walk was starting to warm her. When
she felt that she had walked for long enough she began to do wide skipping 
movements in the manner of a triple jumper. This was to build up some spring
in her stride and to warm up her ankles. She hadn't been running for four days
which is a long time for someone who has it as part of their routine. She 
could feel her legs aching for the stride and the rhythm that they had missed.
A few minutes of the skipping was all it took to launch her into a run. It was
a fast jog rather than a slow run. She went in the same direction they had been
the previous day to have lunch at Captain Joe's. When she passed it she saw 
that it was already open and that people had arrived for their morning coffee.
Did he also sell pastries? She figured that if stopped there on the way home
she could grab a couple of apple danishes to take home. She kept on going and
found another stretch of deserted beach. She ran further than she would on her
normal work days. It seemed like she was getting back to the routine that she
had established during her leave period but this was only the first day. She
continued well beyond Bodega Bay and all the way up to Fort Ross before deciding
to turn back. She didn't really know what Trudy had planned for the day and she
might need to go out which would mean that she would stuck outside. She had her
car keys but Trudy hadn't given her a house key yet. She doubled back to Captain
Joe's in Bodega Bay and found that they did indeed serve pastries for the 
rush. Joe recognised her immediately and joked that Trudy rarely came for 
breakfast. When she left Captain Joe's she felt more reassured that Trudy would
still be at home. When she arrived back to her house on Dillon Beach she saw 
that Trudy was up on the porch with her cup and looking out to sea.
"Hey Trudy. Look what I got. Apple danishes. You ready for breakfast?" she asked
feeling right at home. Trudy smiled and nodded. She handed them to Trudy to
inspect. 
"I got them at Captain Joe's. He said you never went there for breakfast. Smell
good don't they. I'm gonna take a shower real quick, OK?" Betty was gone before
Trudy had a chance to answer. She put the pastries on a plate and made a coffee
for Betty and brought it out to the little coffee table on the porch. Benjy got
up and wagged his tail. It was time for his breakfast too. True to her word 
Betty returned dressed in jeans and a blouse. Her hair was still wet but it was
warm enough to let it air dry. Betty was pleased to see the cafetiere of coffee
on the table but noticed that Trudy was having another herbal infusion probably
camomile.
"Morning", said Trudy,"someone has their energy back I see".
Betty gave her a confused look. And waited for Trudy to speak again.
"You slept for three hours in the afternoon yesterday and you were in bed again
only an hour after dinner. I would say that was a tired person. But not today it
seems."
"I was up at my usual hour and followed my usual routine that's all. Is that 
strange?" asked Betty.
"I'm just messing with you. I figured you might sleep for a little longer that's
all. I didn't know you ran. Not really my thing else I'd go with you but round
here is a great place for it. Some stunning views and not much traffic at all."
"There was some traffic up in Bodega Bay with people getting their morning 
coffees."
"So you got pastries from Captain Joe's. Yeah, I never go there in the mornings.
I usually have a smoothie. We could have that too if you like. I just put a lot
of fruit into a blender. Real easy."
"Sure, sounds nice" said Betty take a bite of her danish and sipping her coffee.
"So you don't drink coffee?" asked Betty.
"Sometimes, but not that often. I like coffee but I'm not one of those people 
that needs it. More recreational rather than a necessity."
"I need it. Can't go a day without my coffee. Sure glad that you have good 
coffee. Thanks for making it by the way, especially as you're not having any
yourself."
"That's OK. You're my guest. Which reminded me that I haven't given you a key."
"I was thinking the same too when I ran past Bodega Bay the first time. I got 
scared that you might have gone out and I wouldn't be able to get in."
"Here you go. It's got both keys on there." said Trudy.
"That's great. Thanks. You got plans for today?" asked Betty.
"No plans at all, just a lazy Sunday. I usually get the paper, go for a walk.
Sometimes I go into Santa Rosa. I guess we should do a little shopping. Two 
mouths to feed now".
"What, are you pregnant?" teased Betty. 
Trudy hit her with a cushion."Shut up".
They both laughed. The sea was choppy today and they both looked out for a 
moment. 
"Trudy, do you sleep sitting up?" asked Betty, "only I saw you sitting upright
with your eyes closed when I checked to see if you were awake".
"I was meditating", chuckled Trudy, "you never seen anyone meditating before?"
"Sure, I've seen monks on TV but that's like far East. I mean I don't know of
anyone that does it so it kind of took me by surprise. I thought that either 
you were sleeping in a special way or you were doing something else. But I 
figured it was best not to disturb you." Betty was confused.
"I started doing it with my acupuncture training and then it was also something
that they recommended with Taekwondo. It really helps you to focus and get 
connected with who you are and how you are."
"What do you do? Do you blank your mind? Is it some kind of trance?" asked 
Betty, still unable to see it in a Western context.
"It's not so much what you do but what you allow to happen. Essentially you
just stay calm and observe your experience. Your thoughts, your emotions, your
senses and other mental events".
"That's kinda what I've been doing the last few days during my trip. Would you
call that meditation?" asked Betty hopefully.
"I guess you could. Yeah. I mean what I do is more of a formal technique but if
the end result is the same then yeah, why not." Trudy wasn't going to explain
too much if Betty was skeptical. She wasn't prepared to defend herself first 
thing in the morning and argue the case for meditation when she felt no need to
justify what she did.
"I can explain the basics to you sometime if you want." offered Trudy.
"Sure. Yeah. I find your whole life fascinating. It's so different from mine.
Especially as we went to college together and have come from similar backgrounds
you know. How the paths of our lives have diverged."
"Well it was all after Gary died like I said. Before that I was a lot more 
mainstream and conventional."
"Does that make me conventional?" asked Betty.
"What I mean is the majority. Most of the population of this country don't live
like I do. They do a 9-5 job and get drunk at the weekend. They watch TV every
evening and eat a lot of pizza and go to the movies." Betty gave her a look.
"OK, not everyone but I'm trying to describe the lifestyles of the majority of
the population of the US of A. You don't agree?"
"Yeah, I guess you're right. Kinda what I've been thinking too but I haven't 
made that jump yet. You know from thinking about it to actually doing something
about it."
"Sure. But you're looking back at my life and it looks like I've taken all these
logical steps leading from one point to the next. But they weren't really 
planned out that way. A lot of the things that happened were accidental. I had
an acupuncture treatment and then got into the whole thing. I mean not everyone
who has treatments do that. Then the Shiatsu and the herbs were part of that.
There was no way of knowing beforehand that I would develop such a passion for 
it. I mean you had a treatment yesterday; do you feel like taking it up?"
"It was great treatment and I've never experienced anything like that before. I
would like to know a little more about it but just a cursory interest. What you
might tell me would be enough I guess."
"So you see, a lot of chance events that really couldn't have been planned or 
predicted. But when you look back you get this impression that I chose all of
the steps quite deliberately. That wasn't the case at all."
Betty nodded in acknowledgement and deliberated.
"I'm gonna go make that smoothie. You still want some?" asked Trudy.
"Yeah, sure."

They decided to go into Santa Rosa as Trudy had suggested earlier as there was
nothing much to do except to sit on the porch and look at the sea. It was a 
great fallback option but Betty was quite keen to see Santa Rosa and do the 
tourist thing. Trudy showed her the sights that she knew and they looked at a 
few others that were signposted. They went to Trudy's favourite wholefood place
to buy groceries. They had them in New York too but Betty had never used them
to do her shopping. She wasn't aware that pesticides were harmful to humans but
only to bugs. They bought fruits and vegetables and a myriad of organic foods
that Betty had never seen before such as nuts, seeds, pulses and legumes. Trudy
had time on her hands so she liked to cook everything from scratch and avoided
eating pre-packed foods as much as possible. Betty watched her shop with an air
of fascination. She couldn't see herself living this way but it was interesting
to see someone living a completely different lifestyle, someone just like her.
They went to a Chinese herbalist shop which was actually open on a Sunday and
bought packets of dried herbs. These were for Betty. Trudy assured her that it
would fine and there was no obligation. When they had finished shopping they 
found a cafe that had lots of tofu on the menu. Betty had never tried it before
but knew what it was. She chose the deep fried kind and to her surprise she 
liked it. They got the Sunday papers and took their time looking through it 
while nibbling on chili rice crackers. Organic of course. They took in a few 
more sights until they had more or less exhausted Santa Rosa and drove back to
Trudy's house on Dillon Beach. The sun had come around now and even though 
there were some clouds in the sky it was quite bright and when the clouds 
parted the sun shone straight onto the porch. The breeze had died down and the
sea was much calmer than it had been in the morning. Betty and Trudy continued
with their papers on the porch after they had put away the shopping. As the 
sun got lower in the sky Betty began to remember her dream from the previous
day during her treatment. She was swimming into the sunset to the sound of the
sea birds. There was still an hour or so till the sun made its way down to the
horizon and even though it was November perhaps it was still warm enough to 
get into the sea for a quick dip. She decided to test the water. She walked
down to the shore and kicked off her shoes. It was cold. Not freezing cold but
cold all the same. She rolled up her trousers and walked in up to her calves.
It was comfortable once you got used to it.
"What are you doing? It must be so cold", called Trudy from the porch.
The tide was coming in so Betty was close enough to hear her. She didn't answer
but wandered back with her shoes in her hand.
"You remember my dream from yesterday? Well I figured that rather than try and
analyse it I would just take it literally swim during the sunset. It is cold 
but I won't be in for long and I'll get used to it," said Betty determindly.
"You go right ahead. I'll get the herbs ready for when you come out." said 
Trudy trying to make it sound appetising.
Betty put on her bathing costume and a bath robe and wandered out to the waters
edge. She turned to look at Trudy. Trudy crossed her arms over her chest and 
rubbed her shoulders and shook her head. Betty waved her away. She removed her
shoes and put her feet into the water. Cold but not really cold. She slipped
off the bathrobe and shivered a little. Was she really going to do this? She
walked further till she was up to her knees and then a step further till the
water was up to her thighs and her fingers were in the water. She took a deep
breath and took a gentle dive forwards. She felt a surge of energy through her
whole body which vanished as soon as it had arrived. Spitting out water she
swam forwards with a very gentle breast stroke and looked directly at the sun.
It was almost at the horizon now. Her skin was covered in goose bumps but as
long as she kept moving she didn't feel the cold. She swam a little further
out so that in her peripheral vision she saw only the sea, the horizon and the
sun in the far distance. It was almost like her dream apart from the cold water
and the sea mist. The sound of the sea birds were clearly audible as were the
sound of the strokes. But what of the peaceful feeling? That was present. It 
was most definitely present. This brought a smile to her face. But it also 
raised a question: was she swimming towards the sunset or was she swimming 
towards her dream? She continued to swim and stayed focused on what she could
remember from her dream. By living out the dream she could keep it alive else
she would forget how it had felt. The sun was now just touching the horizon
and dipping down lower with each stroke. She wanted to continue until the sun
had gone all the way down but she felt another shiver and decided to turn back.
When she got to the shore she put on her bathrobe immediately and turned to 
look a the last rays of the sun. Even though she was a little cold she stood
there until the whole of the sun had descended below the horizon. She was sure
that if she kept repeating the dream then she would be able to understand its
meaning. It was worth a try at least.

Back inside Trudy had a small saucepan on the boil and in it were some of the
dried herbs that she had bought earlier that day from the Chinese herbalist
shop. It was an odd smell like strong earthy mushrooms mixed with mildew and
damp socks. She came closer and took a longer sniff. Betty seemed to be more
curious about it than repulsed by it as most people were. Trudy strained it
into a mug and handed it to Betty. 
"There you go. Those are your herbs. This is another way to unblock those 
channels that were bloked. We used needles yesterday but today we're doing it
internally using these herbs.  Everybody has their own particular mix."
Trudy turned off the cooker and turned on the heating. Betty sat down at the
kitchen table and cupped her potion in her hand. It felt good in her hands as
she was still a bit cold. But was she really going to drink this stuff? She 
brought it up to her nose and took yet another long sniff. Then she took an
sip. She liked it. Like some sort of dilute broth. She was completely taken by
it and didn't notice Trudy watching her drink it. As the special herbal tea
continued to cool she drank it more quickly till it was all gone. She wiped
her mouth with her sleeve. Then she noticed Trudy looking at her.
"Guess I got that recipe right", said Trudy smiling.

********************************************************************************


After their lazy Sunday in Santa Rosa and Betty's first swim at sunset the next
couple of days were spent following much the same routine for Betty with a run
in the morning and pastries from Captain Joe's. On one of the days Trudy made
lunch and they ate on the porch and on another Betty went to Captain Joe's as
she didn't want to disturb Trudy while she was giving treatments. Both of the 
days were clear and Betty went for a short swim at sunset. She was getting used
to the cold now. On the third day, which was a Wednesday was Trudy's weekly 
Taekwondo class. Trudy had invited Betty to come along with her but even though
agreed in principle she wasn't sure about it. She was convinced that someone 
would take the opportunity to kick her butt. Trudy tried to reassure her that
this wouldn't happen as there were kids there and if they got beaten up on their
first try then they wouldn't try again. But as she explained before there was no
watching: you had to participate. It was lunchtime and Trudy had just finished a
treatment and they were sitting on the porch.
"I mean even some mommy who's had a rough day with her kids bitching at her would
get some satisfaction whooping my ass to relieve her frustration", said Betty.
"Betty, it's not like that. It's not like in the martial arts movies where you 
have to prove your worth or show how tough you are before they take you".
"I don't know. I mean you've been going for a long while and you know what you're
doing and I'll be in the noob group and the new kid", said Betty exasperated.
"Betty, you don't have to go with me. I just thought it'd be fun if you came 
along. You've been all fascinated with my lifestyle so here's another way to get
involved. But I just think you'll have fun. But if you want to spend the evening
here alone be my guest, I won't get upset or anything." 
"OK, I'll think about it some more. Do I need to wear a special outfit?" asked
Betty.
"You do, but that's only for people who are a bit more committed. If you just 
want to try it out then you could just wear your running outfit." said Trudy.
"What about lunch?", asked Betty changing the subject.
"You wanna eat here or Captain Joe's?" asked Trudy.
"Captain Joe's", said Betty without hesitation.
"So what, you don't like my cooking?", said Trudy putting on a serious face.
"No. I mean yes, I do like your cooking. But I've been thinking about the crab.
I haven't tried the crab yet and I was thinking about it. Sorry, I know it's not
organic." Said Betty apologetically.
"Don't worry", said Trudy chuckling, "I was only teasing. Captain Joe's it is.
I don't eat organic all the time remember".
"If you're sure", said Betty wondering if she really had been joking.
"Of course I'm sure. Let's go".
They got Benjy and locked the door. Benjy ran off after a bird while Betty and 
Trudy trudged on the dry sand as the tide was higher today and they couldn't walk
on the smooth wet part. 
"I've booked the hospital appointment for you. The mammogram. The earliest I could
get was Friday. Is that OK for you?" asked Trudy in a matter of fact way.
"Yeah, I guess. I didn't realise you were doing that." said Betty.
"Well you said you weren't sure about it and I thought you might appeciate a 2nd
opinion. I'm sorry, I should have asked you first. I can cancel it if you don't
want to go." Trudy realised that she might have overstepped the mark.
"No, it's fine. Thanks. I mean it. It's a really nice thought and it will put me
back in touch with reality rather than trying to find the meaning of swimming at
sunset."
They were quiet for a moment and watched Benjy barking at the birds.
"I chose Friday because I don't have any clients and I could come with you", said
Trudy, "figured you could use a little support. I'm here for you but I don't want
to start making choices for you. I'm sorry if it feels that way".
"It's fine. It really is. I'd sort of forgotten about it, you know, put it to the
back of my mind. Like I was having a break from that too. But you're right, I 
came here to face it rather than run away from it. You did a good thing."
"So we're good?", asked Trudy a little worried.
"Yeah, totally. I'm really grateful." Betty took Trudy's arm. "You're a good 
friend". 
Trudy smiled, finally accepting that Betty wasn't angry with her.
They arrived at Bodega Bay and Captain Joe's diner. It was busier today than it
was the other day they'd come. But there was a table free and Betty ordered the
crab that she'd been thinking about all morning. Trudy had crayfish tails and a
salad. 
"How is it?" asked Trudy
"Mmm. Just as good as I expected. In fact better. This place is amazing. I'm 
going to work my way through the whole menu." said Betty.
Trudy laughed.
During their walk back to Trudy's house Betty agreed to go to the Taekwondo class.

They took Betty's car as Trudy didn't have one and went into Santa Rosa for the 
7.00pm Taekwondo class. Trudy was a regular and had been going for the past five
years. She had told Betty that she liked to train hard but Betty wasn't really
aware of what that meant. I guess that was what she wanted to show Betty. She 
had taken up martial arts training following her husband Gary's death. She said
that it gave her confidence but Betty wasn't really sure what that meant. The 
class was taking place in a basketball court and people were still arriving. 
There were at least a dozen childen with their parents and at least that many
adults. They all bowed when they came through the doors into the hall and then
greeted the people that they knew. There were plastic chairs around the periphery
of the hall where they sat down to take off their shoes and jackets. Some of them
took out bottles of water and sparring pads. Betty could see that in spite of the
discipline there was a friendly atmosphere and she began to feel more comfortable.
Trudy introduced her to the main teacher and told him that she was a beginner and
to take care of her. The teacher asked her if she had any injuries or had had any
recent surgery. Betty was placed in a group with the parents and for a moment she
rememebered her comment about being whipped my a mommy who'd had a bad day. There
were three groups with a teacher at the front of each. Trudy was in the advanced
group with the main teacher. The other two groups comprising mainly of the 
parents and the children were led by advanced students who had to teach as part
of their training. Trudy had to do that too sometimes as she had reached that
level.

The class started with warm ups and all three groups ran around the room. Betty
found his part easy. They had to run forwards, backwards, sideways and change
direction. After a few minutes of that they got into pairs and worked on some
stretching movements. Betty did this sometimes after her run but not often. She
knew that it was something that she ought to do but she was usually in too much
of a rush in the morning to do it. It was painful but her partner was friendly
and didn't push too hard. After that they got into rows and went through some
basic movements. First there were punches then kicks and then blocks. Betty did
her best to keep up with the alien gestures. Next came short combinations and a
turning movement when they reached the end of the room. Then they got into pairs
again. Betty paired with the same woman with whom she'd stretched. They bowed 
to each other and started to work on some attack and defence combinations. First
one would play the role of the attacker then the other. Each combination was
carefully coreographed and as well building on the smooth flow of the movements
they were also working on the timing and correct breathing. The teacher for her
group came close up to Betty and guided her hands through the movements. They
worked on three combinations in all after which it was time for some pure physical
training: push up and sit ups and squatting with a partner on your back. Betty
found this pretty tough but glancing over to Trudy's group she saw them doing
push ups on their finger tips and squatting on one leg while holding the other
one in front of them. Perhaps what she was doing wasn't so tough after all.
After the exercises the main teacher spoke for a moment. He said that as there
was a competition coming up soon for the weeks leading up to it they were 
focusing their efforts on competition training. The next part of the class was
the free sparring. Some people especially those who would be going for the
tournanment were putting on their sparring pads. The teacher for Betty's group
explained that the sparring was full contact or no contact. The tournament was
full contact which was why they had their pads. As well the sparring that was
taking place some of the class were also practicing their kata. This was like
a solo dance sequence and resemled the staccato movements of tango without a
partner. Betty worked with the teacher for her group to learn the first part
of a beginners sequence. She preferred this to the sparring. It took a great
deal of concentration. She watched the children going through their katas and
it was beautiful to watch. She wondered if she would be taking her children to
a martial art class. But then she wondered if she would even be having children
or even being alive in a few years time. For a moment she was gripped by this
feeling and then looked around the room to find Trudy. Trudy was working with
full force against a partner holding up some very thick pads. She was working
on a spinning kick. She was landing the kick every two or three attempts and
cursing each time she missed. Each time she did land the kick the thud of her
foot against the pad echoed around the hall in unison with primal shout that
came from deep within her. Betty turned back to her to own task and thought
that she wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of that kick. She turned 
around again to the sound of clapping when she saw the pad holder lying on
the floor and Trudy with her arms in the air. Trudy was one of the hopefuls
for the tournament and representing the club meant a lot to her. They did some
more sparring and kata until the main teacher called a halt. The whole class
stopped immediately. It was time for the cool down. They did a few gentle
stretches but this time it was done solo. Then they all sat down in a kneeling
position to meditate. It was hard wooden floor which wasn't at all forgiving
to the shins but the group leader told her that it would be very short and
shouldn't be a problem. She looked at the children kneeling in rows and 
followed suit. The main teacher gave instructions. They had to place their 
palms flat on their thighs and close their eyes. Then they breathed in a 
rhythmical way and counted their outbreaths up to ten. The teacher asked them
to focus their attention on the tip of their nose and to feel the sensation of
the air. All that Betty could feel was the pressure of the floor against her
shins. At least it helped her to concentrate. They all opened their eyes slowly
and then stood up. Betty felt pins and needles throughout her shins and feet.
They were all silent for a moment then the main instuctor bowed and the class
bowed in return. Then the two junior instructors bowed to the senior who bowed
back to the them. Everyone then clapped to finish the class in a more Western
manner. Trudy came over and patted Betty on the back.
"Let's go get some food, I'm starving", said Trudy.
"Yeah, me too", agreed Betty.

They went to the same wholefood bistro where they had been a few days ago for
their lazy Sunday afternoon. They ordered tofu burritos with aduki beans and
pumpkin.
"So you liked it then?", asked Trudy with a mouthful of tofu.
"Yeah, I did. I figured I would get bored about halfway through but seeing the
kids doing it and the difficult stuff that your group was doing was really very
inspiring."
"Did any moms whoop your ass?" asked Trudy.
"No. Not at all. They were really nice. You were right. I had a nice time. I'm
glad you persuaded me to come."
"That's great. I'm really glad you enjoyed it." replied Trudy. "We have this
tournament coming up soon so we can't miss any sessions at the moment. They're
rootin for me to get to the ladies finals this year as I got pretty close last
year. It's in December though so I'm guessing you'll be back home by then".
"Wow. I didn't realise you were so dedicated. You hit that pad real hard. I don't
think I'd like to be the one holding it" said Betty looking Trudy in the eye.
"It gives me a way to channel my agression and sort of keep it bottled up for 
when I need it."
"Did you ever need it? I mean did you ever have to defend yourself in real life
I mean?" asked Betty.
Trudy took a sip of her drink before replying.
"When Gary died he was defending our house. He tried his best but he wasn't a 
fighter and he got beat up pretty bad and died of his injuries. I felt so fucking
helpless. Like a stupid bimbo who stands back and watches and shouts his name. 
If I had the skills that I have now I could have taken that guy easy. I woulda
cracked his ribs and snapped his arms". Trudy looked away for a moment.
Betty shuddered when she saw this side to Trudy but seeing your husband getting
beaten to death can't be easy for any woman. She felt awkward and didn't know
what to say. Trudy started staring at her food but not eating it.
"What happened to the attacker?", asked Betty, "did they get him?".
"Yeah, they got him", sighed Trudy, "but he's only got five years or so. The 
sentence was brought down by some technicality and he won't serve out the whole
term due to good behaviour on the inside. Reckon he'll be out soon."
"Trudy, you're not thinking . . ." asked Betty.
"Yeah, I am. It's been on my mind a lot. I'd give it my best shot and if I didn't
make it ... " she trailed off. "Gary's gone. This guy doesn't have a right to be
here while my Gary is gone."
"Trudy you're scaring me. Are you serious?" asked Betty a tad disturbed.
"I'm totally serious. That guy took away the most precious thing I had and now I 
have nothing. All this stuff I do is only to retain my sanity. I've imagined 
killing this guy so many times over. It's the only thing that keeps me going. And
now I might get to do it for real."
Betty was silent. Her quiet and calm friend who was helping her through her own
troubles had troubles of her own and perhaps they were troubles that she was not
ready to hear. They were both quiet for a moment but continued to eat.
"Sorry Betty, I didn't mean to scare you. That was the one and only time when I've
had to defend myself for real but it was already too late. Don't worry Betty, I'm
not going to go chasing after this guy, that's just me being angry. Sometimes I 
miss Gary so much and would easily trade places with him. It all just seems so 
meaningless without him. But I'm trying, I really am trying". Trudy closed her
eyes and held back the tears. 

They got up to leave a moment later and went straight back to Trudy's house on
Dillon Beach. The house where they had been attacked by a burglar and the house
that Gary had tried to defend. Trudy realised that she had scared Betty and had 
lost a little trust but she also knew that she was unstable especially now that
the attacker was about to be set free. Walking the streets to commit more crimes.
Sometimes the urge to track him down and kill him was so strong that it took all
her strength to stop herself from carrying out such a plan. She told Betty that
a wound like that didn't heal overnight and would probably never heal but she 
was doing her best. Betty had come to be somewhere safe where she could relax
and share her troubles and didn't need to be with a crazy lady out for revenge.

********************************************************************************
The day after the Taekwondo class both Betty and Trudy went back to their normal
routines. Trudy was meditating in her room and Betty went out for a run. She 
feel that she had worked the previous day. Her shoulders were aching from holding
her arms in the air from punches and blocks and her legs were aching from all 
the streches. It was a warm day for that time of year and Betty found herself a
little overdressed for her run. She unzipped the top and tied the sleeves around
her waist. She ran past Bodega Bay and Captain Joe's. Her usual route. When she
had set out her plan was to run further than usual but she was finding it too
hot and her energy was used up from the Taekwondo class. She had enjoyed and she
had also learned something about her friend that she didn't know before. She had
planned to mull over some of these things during her run but as she didn't have 
the energy today she opted for a coffee at Captain Joe's. Joe greeted her warmly
and she ordered a coffee and a glass of water. There were 9-5 ers getting their
morning coffee and pastry. Betty got the table by the window as it was free and
didn't mind when a couple of guys asked if they could share. She sipped her 
coffee and looked at the sea through the window. It was so calm today.

Would Trudy really kill this guy? Had she been training specifically for revenge?
People did that. Sure they did. But someone that she knew? Was that possible. Her
own problems had moved into the background she was focused on Trudy. But what 
about all the holistic lifestyle that she lived? Was it all just to contain her
anger and agression. She was hitting that pad pretty hard. Betty couldn't figure
it out. If someone had beat up Steve would she take up martial arts and think
about revenge? But something happens during grief, something very powerful and
it gives you a sense of direction that you feel compelled to follow. It's as 
though a portal opens and you see something that you had never seen before and
what you see seems to cut through how you used to see the world. Your previous
way of looking at things seems naive at best. You chide yourself for having 
looked at the world in that way for so long and realise that there is no time
to waste and start following your own plan. Whether the new sense of clarity is
only a slightly clearer than the previous world view or a lot clearer depends
on the person experiencing the vision but Betty could see that Trudy was on a
path that was borne out of her grief just as she herself was on a new path borne
out of her own grief. Her own path seemed to be more of a philosophical one 
rather than a physical one.

Once she had come to this conclusion the finished up her coffee and then drank
down the glass of water. She smiled at the man sitting next to her who was 
talking to his friend. He got up immediately to let her pass. At the counter
she bought a couple of apple danishes and wished Joe a good day. She walked back
to the hous rather than running. Trudy had finished her meditation and was out
on the porch. She was looking grave and worried.
"Hey. How're you feeling this morning? Aching at all?", asked Trudy.
"Yeah, a little I guess. Actually, yes. I'm pooped. Didn't have the energy to
run properly" answered Betty. She handed Trudy the pastries.
"You OK with how I was last night? I bet you weren't expecting that?" Trudy 
needed to know where Betty stood on this issue.
"I was thinking about it this morning. It just feels like you have been following
a plan and waiting to take your revenge but I can't believe you're so calculated."
"No I'm not. That's the thing. I forgot about that guy and even though I was angry
it was never my intention to go and hunt him down. Sure I wanted him dead some
of the time but that wouldn't have brought Gary back. It would only have brought
be a moment of peace or a moment of something."
"You'd be in jail", said Betty.
"Yeah, but when that feeling of revenge takes you, you don't think about the 
consequences."
"I guess not."
"I started the martial arts as a way to control and release my agression that part
was true. And when I started I wasn't capable in the way I am now. I wasn't sure
that I would have stuck with it for so long. I figured that I'd do it for a while
just to calm down, you know like a kind of therapy. Then I had all this Chinese
medicine that took up so much of my time. All that was very peaceful. But the guys
at the dojo, I mean the club really encouraged me as they could see potential so
I stuck at it. Betty, my only focus is the tournament believe me. I don't want to
hurt anyone. There is enough violence in the world. I don't want to add to it."
"OK. That makes sense. I'm not judging you or anything, it just all seemed a bit
out of place against your meditation and acupuncture."
"Sure. I guess that was another reason I wanted you to come to the class. But 
talking of acupuncture I have clients today so we can't really hang much. You're 
more than welcome to stay here but you'll need to be quiet."
Trudy prepared the breakfast things and they sat down properly.
"Gorgeous day. Feels almost like summer. Well, it's warm and sunny but not hot.
Why don't you take a trip North and check out some of the vineyards. You could 
get us a case of wine for this evening." said Trudy.
"A case? You planning on getting shitfaced?" asked Betty incredulously.
"No," laughed Trudy, "it's just that you can get decent wine at a good price so
you might as well get a case or two. They mark it up a lot at the supermarket.
You'll get some great views up there".
"How many treatments do you have?" asked Betty.
"Bout five today, maybe six, I need to check. So it's kind of a full day. A couple
in the morning then more in the late afternoon and early evening. So I'll be tied
up for most of the day. Imagine I'll be pooped by the time you get home."
"OK. Sounds like a plan. Maybe I should grab some chow on the way home. What do
you think?" asked Betty.
"Yeah, that would be great. Especially with the wine".
"My first one is in half an hour so I best start getting my shit together. You 
need a map or anything?" asked Trudy.
"No, I'm good. I'll just follow the signs, have a little adventure."
"OK, well, sorry to rush things but I'll see you later on then and you can tell
me all about it."

Betty was showered and dressed and put on her sunglasses. It was bright but not
too hot. She got in her rental car and saw another car approaching as she was
manoevering herself onto the road. That must be Trudy's first client she thought.
She remembered lying on the massage bed with the needles in her arm. Would be 
nice to have that on a regular basis. Once she was out of the residential area
of Dillon Beach and the main route to Santa Rosa she turned North as Trudy had
suggested. The road was quiet and sunny and she had just missed all the commuter
traffic. She wished that she had a convertible at this point. She put on the 
radio and cruised as she had done on her way over to Trudy's. After only forty
minutes drive she was passing signs to bodegas and winerys. She had no idea which
were the better ones, it just a case of choosing one. She decided to take the 
next exit and ended up on a dirt track leading to Los Molinos. When she arrived
at the car park there was coach party with tourists from San Francisco. She was
not really sure where to go asked one of the party. After a short conversation
with the tour leader she was invited to join them. It was a tour of the winery
with talks on its history and tasting of course. Lunch would be provided and
they would also get discounts on any purchases. She offered to pay a share but
they were all happy to have her tag along. She accepted and added her own crunchy
gravel footstep sounds. A minute later the man from Los Molinos, their host for
the day arrived and introduced himself.

They walked through a couple of fields and were told about the soil and the grape
variety. About how they had developed it. In the clear sun that day it was the
ideal destination. They were shown into the presses and the fermentation vats.
Finally into the bottling and corking area. He explained how some people still 
preferred the cork in spite of the screw cap being perfectly usable. There were
also wine boxes. There was was white, red and some rose too. Some bottles of
fortified wine and various Los Molinos tableware made by local artisans. They
produced six different varieties and exported their wine worldwide. Betty was
not much of a wine expert but she liked what she tasted. She realised why these
people had arrived on a coach: they weren't spitting. Betty made sure that she
spat. They were a very friendly group and she had lunch with a retired couple 
from San Francisco who lived near the Botanical Gardens. They'd seen this place
in a guide book in the summer and thought it would be a nice day trip. After 
lunch everyone made their purchases and the party was back on the coach crunching
on the gravel out of the car park. Betty waved them goodbye and as it was still
early she decided to take a walk. Having packed her cases of wine in her car
she drove a little further north to find a walking trail. She found more middle
aged couples with walking sticks and followed the signs. She wasn't thinking, she
wasn't worrying, just enjoying nature.

Late afternoon she started driving back to Santa Rosa. It was a short drive and
she didn't want to arrive while Trudy still had clients. She bought tofu burritos
at the wholefood diner and then headed home. She hadn't thought about anything 
today and it was a relief. A real break from herself.

She had timed it well as Trudy's last client for the day was just leaving. Trudy
waved to her as she got out of the car. She saw that Betty had luggage and went
out to help her.
"Hey. Wow, two cases. That should keep us in booze for a while. Cool, you got
burritos too. Maybe you should just stay here" she quipped.
"That's funny, I was thinking that today." said Betty, "I had such a great time
at this wine place and then I went for a walk in the hills. It was a great 
suggestion. I just felt so free and easy and didn't think about any of my shit".
Betty closed the doors and locked it before picking up her box of wine and 
followed Trudy into the house.
"Let's crack one open shall we?", said Trudy.
They poured and clicked glasses. They devoured their burritos and the food made
them drowsy. They'd both had had full days and went to bed very soon after eating.
Just as well really as the following day was Betty's hospital appointment in
San Francisco.

The hospital appointment was for 12:00 in San Francisco. It was only an hour or so
away but they decided to leave an extra half an hour for possible delays. This gave
them plenty of time to follow their morning routine. Betty went out along the beach
for her morning run while Trudy did her meditation practice. Betty returned with 
pastries from Captain Joe's and they had breakfast on the porch. Betty was a fidgety
this morning and obviously nervous. It was nearly time to leave. 
"Come on Betty, let's do this. You're not wimping out me now are you?" said Trudy
in a bit to elicit some bravado.
"Nah, I'm good." said Betty rising to the challenge. Within a few minutes they were
in the car ready to go. Betty sighed and Trudy nodded.
They didn't head towards Santa Rosa but took the Valley Ford Road and the Bodega
Road to Petaluma where they got onto Highway 101 which took them South to San
Francisco. The highway took them directly to San Francisco General Hospital in 
just under an hour. They were early. But the time got taken up looking for parking.
The parking had annoyed them both but had the effect of taking their minds off the
reason they were visiting. Betty found the map from the appointment letter and they
started to find their way. It was 11:55 when they found the right department and
there was only a small queue. There were only two people before them even though
a lot more people sitting and waiting. About a quarter of an hour later Betty's 
name was called and they both went inside. Trudy explained that she was the one
that had made the appointment on behalf of her friend who was visiting from out
of town. She explained that she had already been diagnosed but was looking for
a second opinion. The doctor was on the point of putting them through the usual
bureaucratic channels when he had a change of heart and decided to go ahead with
the examination. Betty was a bag of nerves but managed to hold herself together
with Trudy present. The doctor examined her and took a mammogram. Minutes later
he showed her the x-ray on the light box. They could all see the large white
shadow. The doctor pointed to it.
"I'm sorry to have to tell you this but that there spot is a tumour. I can see
you also have an inverted nipple and you're getting pain in your breast. There
is no way of breaking this to you gently. You have breast cancer. I don't know
what your doctor in New York told you but you need to get this treated pretty
soon."
This doctor was more direct than the one in New York but he also seemed to be
more caring.
"You feeling nauseous?"
She nodded.
"Pain in your armpit? Difficult to move your arm sometimes?"
She shook her head.
"I'm surprised that it got to such an advanced stage before you noticed anything.
But you need to act fast miss 'cos this thing is only getting bigger and it needs
to be taken out. It'll spread through your whole body and then it'll kill you. 
Modern as medical science may be we got surgery and chemo when it comes to cancer
and a whole host of alternative therapies that may or may not work. If it was me
I'd make an appointment for surgery as soon as possible before those cells start
spreading. After that we would need to do the chemo. But hey, it's your choice.
We don't put pressure on anyone to do anything but what I want to impress upon
you is that this is urgent and you need to do something about it soon."
"OK, thanks I guess" said Betty.
"There's nothing more I can tell you I'm afraid and I'm sorry to have to confirm
what you already knew. And now I'm going to have to say goodbye to you and wish
you all the best because as you will have seen, there are other waiting."
They both nodded and left the room.
"Let's get out of here", said Betty,"I feel like I need some air".
"I bet you do", said Trudy, "how about we go to the park. There's a small one
nearby. We can walk there."
"OK, yeah, that sounds good. I think we still have some minutes on the parking".
They went to Potrero del Sol park. It was a green area but surrounded by big 
roads and full of kids on skateboards. It was perfect for a short interlude.
They sat on a grassy knoll and watched the kids with their baseball caps and
baggy shirts trying to master tricks and jumps. Trudy told her that she came
here a few times when Gary was at the hospital which of course brought back 
memories of those times. After a few minutes Betty felt a little better and
she was also worried about getting a parking fine so they went back to the car
and drove to the Mission District.
"If you want to get a really good burrito then you have to come here. Santa Rosa
isn't bad but here is where it's at," said Trudy.
"How about this one?" asked Betty.
"Yeah, any one is good really", said Trudy.
After their lunch they went to Chinatown where Trudy got some herbs. 
"You can't get everything in Santa Rosa so I come here once in a while. As you
can see, they have it all." Trudy looked like a kid in a toyshop.
They did a couple of touristic visits to Haight / Ashbury and the Embarcadero.
But Betty wanted to get out of the city. It was just before the evening rush
hour so they'd be out in good time. Once they were back on the porch Betty 
heaved a sigh of relief to be back to somewhere that she called home. Trudy was
preparing another herbal infusion with the herbs she had bought. This was a follow
up to the one she had had a few days ago but now with an added ingredient which she
was missing before. Once again Betty drank it all down as though it was her 
favourite cup of coffee. They both sat and watched the waves and took in what had
happened that day.

********************************************************************************
The morning after their wedding bleary eyed and wondering what had hit them Betty
and Steve placed their suitcases in the boot of their parents car. Betty's mother
was driving them to JFK for an 8.00am flight to Mumbai from where they would get
a connecting flight to Panjim in Goa. She had packed their bags while did their
wedding night thing and gently woke them when it was time to get ready. It was
the beginning of their married life and they were going on a luxury holiday to 
Goa on the West Coast of India. They had chosen it partly because Betty enjoyed
a great sunset and because it was a fashionable destination amongst their friends.

A moment after the thud of the passenger door the gas pedal went down gently and
Betty's mother Judy steered the car carefully to the end of the drive and out 
onto the road. It was Sunday morning and very quiet. Not a peep from the n
neighbours and even the birds seem to only just waking up. It was late summer
and just starting to get light. Although she didn't really need them the head-
lights were on just for safety. Judy turned furtively to check on the young 
folks. Sensibly strapped in for the ride and sunglasses to hide their bruised
brains. They were getting ready for the adventure of their lives. There was no
turning back.

It wasn't long before Judy had nosed the sedan onto a faster road and they 
cruised along without talking. Betty occasionally nudged Steve with her elbow
and pointed at something through the window. Judy glanced back now and then 
and asked if they were OK. They were children to her after all.

At JFK they found a luggage trolley and loaded their cases onto it. "You take
care of my little girl," said Judy with tears in her eyes as she hugged Steve
warmly. Betty and Judy looked at each other and said nothing for a moment as
they held back the tears. They hugged convulsively with an intermittent sob.
Each forced a smile as they grabbed the final pieces of luggage and walked 
toward the terminal doors. Judy wiped her eyes and waved feebly before getting
back into the car. 

The Air India check-in desk wasn't too far away and they joined the queue that 
was gradually building up. Any later and it would have been annoyingly long. 
Betty took off her glasses and looked at the tickets. Judy had packed those 
too. She smiled with a tight lip as she thought of her mother while they both
scanned the departure area. "Just you and me now," she thought to herself.

So far Trudy was the only one who knew about Betty's cancer after having it
confirmed in California. But she had to tell someone much closer to her. Her
husband perhaps. How would he take it if he told her? How would he take it if
she didn't tell her? She figured it would be worse in the long run if she 
didn't tell him. But just how long was the long run?

As they boarded their flight and found their way to their seats and packed the
hand luggage, she felt as though everyone knew that it was the biggest thing
on her mind and that Steve was the only person who didn't know. Could she not
hand the responsibility over to one of the other passengers or crew? He smiled
at her as he pushed the overhead locker door closed and sat down next to her.
"You got your book?", he asked.
"Sure, it's right here. How's your head?" she asked back.
"I'll live", he said, turning his eyes upward.
"I've got aspirins if you need. You'll probably sleep it off".
"Yeah", he said as they both started to absently fumble through their books
and start settling in for the flight.

They were newly married but they weren't all over each other as you might 
expect. They were both a little reserved in that department and came across 
more like a couple that had been long married rather than recently. As she 
thumbed her way to her bookmark she looked out of the window, staring more than
looking, thinking about when she might break the news. Did it have to be right
now? Perhaps she should give it a few days and enjoy her holiday first.  

Aside from the main meal and a movie they both managed to sleep their way
through the flight. 

Arriving from a cold December morning in New York City the heat is quite 
noticeable when they exit the plane at Mumbai. There is a gentle breeze that
causes their clothes to flutter and they can feel it in their hair. It's warm
but not hot like summer in New York. But there's a smell that is quite 
unfamiliar to them. They walk down the steps to the terminal building and it's
it's like waking up inside a dream, especially as for most of the flight they
were asleep. Betty yawned. Steve smiled and put his arm around her.
"We're here. We're married. We're fucking married", said Steve.
"Uh huh," said Betty, "so we are".
"How long do we have till we get our connecting flight?", asked Steve.
"I think it's pretty soon. I remember we booked it that way so we wouldn't have
to hang around here for too long.", said Betty.
"Good plan", said Steve,"Do you have the documents?"
"They're in here somewhere", said Betty.
"I could really do with a drink", said Steve.
"Are you sure? We both had a hell of a lot last night. You not hungover or
anything?", asked Betty.
"Nope. And I didn't that much. I mean a little champagne and some wine with the
dinner. But that was all."
"Yeah, right. What about all those beers later on?"
"Ah. They're just beers. They don't count."
"OK".
Steve wasn't an alcoholic or someone who lost it when they were drunk. She 
didn't mind him drinking and could match him glass for glass when it came to
alcohol units. She knew that if he had a drink then she would probably have one
too and start talking. She wasn't ready to start talking just yet. But a drink 
would nevertheless be very nice indeed.
"I think I'd like a drink too", said Betty gazing at her imaginary halo.
Steve gave out sudden belly laugh that was infectious and Betty sniggered too.
They were being happy with each other but they weren't happy. It was all just 
one big show. Steve was angry with Betty for going off to California and taking
her problem to Trudy. He wasn't going to forgive her for that. And Betty of 
course had cancer. Two doctors independently of each other had confirmed it.
She couldn't pretend that it wasn't there. She so wanted to tell him but she 
was also very scared. Let's just enjoy being married and being the happy couple
and then the right time will present itself.

Inside the terminal building there was a very long queue. Now they wondered
whether it would have been better to have gotten a charter flight rather than
a scheduled one and gone straight there. They couldn't do anything about it
now as they had arrived in Mumbai. Bag searches, clothes searches, questions
and lots of x-ray machines that seemed old and defunkt. Could be a while till
they got their drink.
"How soon is that connecting flight?", asked Steve.
"I'll see if I can find the details while we're waiting". She looked down into
her handbag and thumbed through a few pages. 
"Ah, here we go. Oh shit." Betty looked grave, "Leaves in an hour". 
"Jesus, that's tight."
"But we booked these before September, so how were we to know it would take
this long."
"If we had waited any longer the price would have gone so much higher."
"And we wouldn't have got a seat anyways".
"True", said Steve.
"We'll make it and we can have a drink on the plane".
"I like your style Mrs. Turner".
Betty laughed again and picked up her bag as the line was moving.
"I could use a cigarette you know. That was a long flight", said Betty.
"I'm surprised you didn't mention it before", said Steve.
"Well, I had my chewing gum to see me through, but that isn't a real smoke 
though is it?"

There was just enough time after they had collected their luggage to have 
a smoke and then gradually make their way to the departure lounge for their
next flight. They were both tired and both smiling and they were both looking
forward to a drink. It was going to be a very short flight so as soon as they
were airborn and the trolley came past they ordered some hard liquor. Scotch
and soda. In an hour they could probably drink at least three if not more. 
For some reason they wanted to keep going. The flight attendants didn't care
as they were making money. The alcohol was starting to hit them and before
they knew it the plane was starting its descent and they were getting ready
to land. They were grinning now rather than smiling and teasing each other.
Passengers in the seats adjacent to them began to feel a little irritated
but that had always been their intention.

It wasn't long before they were sitting in the back of their taxi at Vasco da 
Gama Airport and heading toward their hotel. The Taj Exotica hotel an 
Benaulim Beach. They had chosen one that was both luxurious and away from the
usual revellers in the Northern part of Goa in Baga, Calangute and Anjuna. They
wanted an idyllic holiday that would be devoid of any undesirables as Betty 
liked to call it. She didn't like wasps on her dessert. Benaulim was certainly
quiet and they could not have picked a better time to visit Goa. The monsoon
rains had come and gone the vegetation was lush. The sun was shining but it
wasn't too hot and sea looked very inviting. They had also read that the 
Christmas time was nice there as it was a Christian part of the country. But
Steve was keen to return to New York for a family Christmas.

They started to unpack some of their things and put on their summer clothes.
When got halfway through the unpacking they decided to go out for a little 
walk. Explore the territory. Shorts and sandals on both of them and the small
amount of Indian currency that they had brought with them. They glided out of
the hotel leaving their key at the desk. Steve put his arm around Betty, his
wife and moved his hand lower and lower till it slipped beyond her waistband
and into her knickers. She smirked at him as they continued to walk and made
their way to the beach. The sound of the sea was very calming and drove away
their frisky feelings. The fidgety giggly nervous energy they got from the
alcohol was also fading away too. There was a half-moon but it was bright
enough to light their way and they saw others quietly walking along the beach
as though they were riding on a conveyor belt. They felt a sense of connection
with nature and their mood was deep but not pensive. The palm trees, the sand
and the gentle motion of the sea helped them to feel that they had indeed
arrived at their destination and that nothing could disturb their calm. It was
a million miles away from the chaos that was New York and even the few short
minutes of peace and tranquility was beginning to revive them. 

Betty decided that she wanted to take a swim. The water was fairly calm and when
she put her foot into it to test the temperature she simply had to take a dip.
Steve also wanted to join her but didn't feel reckless enough to skinny dip. They
went back to their hotel to find their swimming gear but got a little frustrated
when they couldn't find it immediately. When they realised that they might miss
the moment they decided that it was skinny dipping or nothing. They took some 
towels and their sandals and found a spot as close to their hotel as possible so
that when they came out they could return quickly. The beach was sandy and easy 
on the feet. They could see the moonlight reflected on the water and in swayed
with the movement of the waves. With their towels wrapped around them and their 
feet in the water they dropped their towels and quickly waded into the gentle 
waves till they were in up to their necks. They were standing on the seabed with
only their neck and shoulders above the water. They looked at each other and the
the tiny ocean of water between them dancing around. They walked in a step 
further until the water came up to their noses and they looked into each others
eyes. Betty started blowing bubbles and was closely followed by Steve. Then she
spat some water at him and turned and swam. Steve followed her but the frivolity
soon passed and they felt that calm again. They both floated on their backs for
a little while and then came closer to the shore where they could stand with 
their heads out of the water. They stood at a depth that was just a bit deeper
than waist level and embraced with a slow kiss. No words needed to be spoken. 
They were on their honeymoon, standing in the sea in the moonlight naked and 
together. A perfect union of everything that was good in their lives.

The kiss was loving and full of warmth rather than being sensual and arousing. 
The water was warm enough for them to remain with their arms around each other
for a little while before coming back to the shore and putting on their towels.
A stray dog came and sniffed them as they put on their sandals to walk back to
their hotel room. They closed the doors and the curtains and once they had dried
themselves off they fell into bed. 

They woke up the following morning while in the later part of the morning. They
hadn't asked for a wake up call so had missed breakfast. They opened the french
doors and were welcomed by a view of palm trees, sand and sea. There were a few
stray dogs sniffing around and occassionally there was a cow walking along the 
beach. Betty and Steve had no plans except to enjoy themselves and to enjoy 
their new commitment to each other. Their whole lives to get used to this new 
way of being. Even though they had been living together for a few years being 
married wasn't the same. It had a different feeling about it which they were 
both beginning to appreciate. Among the people walking past the front of their
chalet was a lady dressed in a sari with a basket on her head. She saw them 
looking at her and immediately changed direction and approached them. They were
not expecting such a response but waited to see what would happen. She asked if
they would like some fruit and gave them a list of what was available. Steve
helped her down with her basket. She was carrying fresh coconuts, pineapple and
bananas. She also had a couple of bags of cashew nuts. They went to town and got
a whole lot of fruit. The fruit lady was very happy and made her basket very 
light. She told them that they had made good business for her. They bought a 
fresh young coconut each which mainly contained coconut milk. The fruit lady
cut the top open with her machete and gave them each a straw. The bought some
pineapple pieces and a whole papaya. They didn't need to think about what to 
have for breakfast.
*********************************************************************************
The drumming had started and reached Betty's ears from the short distance she had 
swam out towards the sun. The water was still warm but only half the sun now 
remained above the horizon. The spinning orb seemed to be rippling in time 
with her body movements. The drum rhythms seemed to be out of sync with her 
own movements, the sea and the sun. They grated slightly but called to her. 
She faced about from the sun and looked back towards the beach. A couple of 
guys with dreadlocks were playing frisbee with the waves lapping their shins 
and behind them driftwood branches were being added to the fire. There were a 
handful of drummers seated close to the fire tapping out simple earthy rhythms 
while a girl in a tye died sarong danced with closed eyes. "What a bunch of 
fucking hippies", thought Betty as the sun went down further and she could feel 
a subtle breeze blow over her neck and shoulders. It was getting cold and the 
fire looked inviting and the sound of the drums continued to beckon. She was 
feeling hungry too. A few more were gathering around the fire but only a dozen 
or so in total which was about as much as Betty could handle right now. She 
liked the fact that it was just out of season and the beach was quite deserted. 
As she reached the point where she could stop swimming and start walking the 
frisbee players stopped their game and headed closer to the fire. One of them 
handed Betty her towel as she came out of the sea. 
"Thanks", she said. "Bit chillier than usual tonight isn't it?" 
"Yeah man, good thing we got plenty of wood," he said, nodding toward the 
pile that had been built. She started drying herself off as she moved closer 
to the fire. Some of the others simply nodded in greeting as she caught their 
eyes. She tilted her head to one side and put the towel up against the back of 
her neck. The warmth of the sun now replaced by the fire and a virtually 
windstill night. She took a deep drag of a joint and passed it on quickly so 
that she could keep on drying herself. Still standing she looked into the flames. 
"Fucking hippies? Who am I kidding. I'm one of them now. I'm a fucking hippie too." 
She smiled to herself as the thought passed through her mind.
Although the warm evenings had passed it wasn't anything like a cold winter. 
A sarong and a thin shawl next to the fire were more than adequate on top of 
her bikini. The food was arriving and being doled out banana leaves. The 
drummers had stopped their drumming in order to take their meal. Bottles 
of beer were being passed around along with the local moonshine. People 
were nodding their approval of the food and the faster eaters were already 
reaching for seconds. Pieces of coconut and pineapple for dessert. Another 
joint was being prepared and the used plates were passed along. There was 
a general hush during the meal as they wrapped their shawls tighter around 
them and put more wood onto the fire. The joint maker reached for a twig from 
the fire to light it and after taking a few long deep puffs passed it on. 
Some sat cross legged while others reclined on their rugs and mats half 
covered in sand. Only the gentle sound of the waves, the subtle crackle 
of the fire and the odd swigging sound of a beer bottle. Each of them 
seemed in agreement about keeping the silence and enjoying the final 
remnants of the day. A few more sips and a few more puffs and the 
conversations would begin.
*********************************************************************************
Betty, Alex and Rufus are all at the cafe on the beach having their breakfast
and looking out to sea. It's a little chilly and there is a breeze blowing the
sand but they have dutifully come to their usual spot to take their breakfast.
Alex grins at them before announcing that he's had a dream that he'd like to
share.
"Oh god Alex, do we have to share our dreams as well?" sighed Betty. "I'm not
sure if I can deal with this so early in the morning."
"Betty, come on", said Rufus, "this sounds like a corker. He knows what you're
like about all that bollocks. I'm a bit skeptical too as it happens unless I've
had a wee dram or two."
Alex took a sip of his tea and decided to put more sugar into it. 
"Banana fucking porridge again", he said, "drives me mad it does. But then it's
part of this whole experience isn't it."
It was a rhetorical question and they sensed it was his way of taking the stage
and recounting his dream. They all stared out to sea before turning back to the
table as if it was a micro prayer and they were offering this story to the sea.

Betty stirred her tea and took a sip and turned to Alex with an slight upward
nod. He grinned again and swallowed another mouthful of porridge. 
"It was so real man, it was like I was there, I mean here. In my dream I was
here on the beach but it was a bit of a grey day, a bit like back home. And
there was this guy pulling a boat out of the sea. Just a small rowing boat but
it was heavy. I mean it looked heavy. I asked if I could give him a hand and
he was well pleased. So we both pulled in this boat which was much heavier 
than it looked. He wouldn't let me look inside it but I was quite insistent
so he gave in in the end. The waves were lapping up and gently rocking the 
boat and I could see something moving inside. There was some blue plastic
tarp covering whatever was in there and I could smell it more than I could 
see it. The guy shrugged his shoulders and made a gesture that I should look
underneath it so I did. And lo and behold it was you two! I mean I was so
gobsmacked that I almost fell backwards. I couldn't really figure out if you
were dead or if you were sleeping. There were fish in the boat too so I guess
the smell was coming from there. But I couldn't figure it out. The guy could 
see that I couldn't figure it out and so he grinned at me as though he was 
about to tell me but he didn't. He just carried on grinning and shrugged his
shoulders again. I was just about to shake you to see if you were sleeping
or dead when more boats started turning up on the beach with their boatman
coming out to pull it ashore. As I started looking up and down the shore to
see the boats being pulled in I saw the man grinning again. I suppose he was
thinking like, should I tell this guy or let him figure it out for himself.
And that was it really. Got a bit hazy after that." 

"Fuck man, hope that's not a premonition or anything", said Rufus opening his
eyes wide.
"So you didn't figure out if we were dead or sleeping?" asked Betty.
"I guess not", said Alex.
"That's deep man", said Rufus with a long sigh."At least, it means something
I guess".
"It doesn't mean anything. I wouldn't read anything into it", said Betty 
shaking head. "It's just nice to know that we figure in your dreams and that
you care enough to tell us about it but other than that there isn't anything
deep and meaningful to take from it."
"Always the skeptic eh. I'll tell you what it means", said Alex finishing his
final spoonful of porridge. "It means that I'm going to look after you if 
you're asleep or dead. I was here first and you both came afterwards and now
we're travelling together. Well, we hang out a lot together. And the boatman
is the hand of fate who can see that we go well together so decided to put
us together. Yeah, think that's my basic interpretation."
"Go Alex. Put on some gypsy earrings and tell us our fortune while you're at
it. You seem to know your stuff." Betty was being sarcastic but she was also
getting a little irritated. She was still new to all this New Age mumbo jumbo
and psychological nonsense as she called it. She took another gulp of her tea
and pushed back her chair to get up. 
"I'm going down to watch the waves. You guys coming?" Betty picked up her bag
and mat and wandered toward the shore.
"Alex man, you pissed her off", said Rufus.
"Nah, she's alright, probably something on her mind and doesn't want to 
listen to my bollocks." Alex took a gulp of tea. "Shall we go and join her?"

As they walked the few feet from the cafe to the shore they could see people
staring out to sea and lots of people coming closer to the shore and 
pointing. Betty stood up to see what was happening and exchanged glances
with Alex and Rufus. Each made a slight shrug. Then people higher up the 
bank grew more ardent with their pointing while other craned their necks and
squinted their eyes. There was something floating towards the beach from the
horizon. From a distance it looked like one of those inflatable lifeboats but
was orange. As it came closer there was a distinct waft of rotting flesh. Now
they could see that it wasn't orange but more orange and grey. Some came even
closer to the shore while others moved away. The object was gradually being 
washed closer and closer to the shore and drifting into where Alex had had 
his dream about the boat carrying Betty and Rufus. They both looked at him.
"Nostra fuckin' damus mate", said Rufus.
Betty clutched her nose to avoid the stink. She picked up her things and 
started to wander away from the shoreline. 
"What is it?", asked Alex, not to anyone in particular. There was a fisher-
man standing near them who recognised it immediately. 
"It's a dolphin. Probably been dead a few days. Sometimes they get washed up
on the beach. It's quite a big one."
The decaying mass soon washed up onto the beach and now most of the onlookers
stepped further and further away. The braver among them went for the closer
look. The fisherman went to call for help and have it removed. Once the 
curiosity value was over it could be detrimental to the tourist trade so the 
sooner the better.
"Don't think I'm going to swim today." said Betty.
"Rotten dolphin flesh is great for exfoliating the skin. Better than Dead Sea
mud any day." said Rufus.
"Yeah? Why don't you try it then?" said Betty. "Think I might go for a run. 
Up for a run?" She looked at both of them in turn as she asked.
"But what about the dream? It means something now doesn't it?" said Rufus.
"Drop it mate, let's leave it for today. I'm sorry I mentioned it now", said
Alex looking dejected.
"Don't mind me. You can't stop being yourself just to please me. If we're 
planning to travel together and spend more time together then we gotta have 
these things out. I really don't want us to be changing our ways to fit. We're
not at work and we're not trying to please our bosses here. we're free aren't 
we? At the forefront of our lives with no plans and no destination in mind."
Betty need to reassure them that even though the hippy stuff did irritate her
she was willing to put up with it as it was the culture of most travellers.
"Cheers, Mrs." said Rufus. Alex nodded in agreement.
"I can see you're not interested in a run, so I'll catch you guys later. I 
won't be too long. Maybe we can take a trip further down the beach where
the water is a bit cleaner. Arambol perhaps? I don't fancy the flea market
crowd today." She raised a hand and walked off toward her hut.

Rufus and Alex went back to the cafe for another tea and saw a truck arrive
to remove the dead dolphin. It didn't take them long to clean up and soon it
was as though nothing had happened. They sipped their tea and looked out to
sea.
*********************************************************************************
On most days around sunset the bar at the top of the hill would start to pump out
techo music to signify the start of the evening. It was called Joe Banana but had
recently changed management and was now called the Paradise Bar. It attrated old
and young alike mainly looking like travellers and hippies but they didn't all 
have that background but looked as though they did. When in Rome as they say. The
sound isn't especially loud and usually sounds very distant and muffled but 
tonight it was very loud even from the beach which meant that it must be quite
deafening at the bar itself. Betty looked up toward the Paradise Bar from her
deck chair and looked at the others. 
"What's happening?", she asked.
"Full moon tonight. There'll be a few full moon parties." said Rufus.
"Do they have to put it so loud? Those guys must be going deaf." said Betty.
"They want to attract attention. They can make a lot of money on a full moon 
night, so that's why it's loud. People meet at the bars to get the locations of
the secret parties", said Alex.
"Why are they secret?", asked Betty.
"Because of the drugs mainly. Goa is very anti-drugs or at least is seen to be.
As soon as the police hear about any event like this they'll be there in a shot.
They'll take bakshish but they'll also break up the party as well. Sometimes 
there are decoy parties as well, where they'll have a smaller party and they
will publicise that one more than the main one and if it does get busted then
the police generally don't look for another one", said Alex again.
"You been to a full moon party?", asked Rufus looking at Betty.
"No, I haven't".
"Oh man, we have to go then".
"It's not really worth it. I mean it's just like any other trippy techno beach
party isn't it", said Alex.
"Come on man, it's a real spectacle. Betty should give it a look. Maybe even 
take something", said Rufus.
"What do you mean take something?", asked Betty.
"He means drugs", said Alex.
"Yeah, like drop an e or a trip. Bit o' whizz maybe. Good mushrooms here too",
said Rufus as though he was reading from a restaurant menu.
"I'm not sure Betty's into all that, are you Betty?", asked Alex as he looked
at Betty.
"Nope, never tried any of those things. Coffee and alcohol is as far as I've 
been. But who knows, there's a first time for everything." Betty shrugged but
didn't dismiss the idea out of hand.
"Oh right", chuckled Rufus,"Might be a bit full on then."
"What do you mean, full on?" asked Betty. Sometimes there were language 
problems between English UK and English US. 
"What he means is that the experience of taking any of the drugs that he mentioned
could and probably would be quite overwhelming especially as you've never had
that experience before. It would a completely new experience and you would be
a big crowd of people in the dark with the possibility of a police prescence.
Sometimes they like to make examples of foreign tourists even though their 
economy depends on it. They want to show that any undesirable elements are not
home grown. But the main thing for you is that taking any form of drug is a 
journey into the unknown and in my opinion it's better to do it for the first
time in a much safer environment. You know, maybe just the three of us in a
room or a quiet beach or something, so if anything did go wrong, I mean not
that it would but you know if it did, then we could help out more easily."
explained Alex.
"What could go wrong? I mean how is it different from getting seriously drunk?
Sometimes you throw up or do some silly things but I can't see anything worse
than that," said Betty looking confused.
"Oh man, you're being all heavy man. It's not that big a deal. You do an e and
you get a bit loved up. Or you do a trip and see everything go a bit wobbly or
snort some whizz and run around. I mean it's just a bit of a laarf innit?"
said Rufus putting his point of view.
"Well, that's what I was thinking", said Betty,"if you take a safe amount then
it's like getting drunk or something. Am I wrong?"
Alex didn't want to come out and say that she was naive or that he was over
playing the dangers. But the dangers were very real and he needed to get that
message across without making her angry or feel stupid. If anything that would
make her want to do it even more to prove a point. And proving a point was her
job.
"OK, put it this way, can you think back to when you first had a drink. Say in
your teens or whenever it was. And Rufus, can you think back to when you had 
your first Extacy experience or LSD? I mean not just what you did and how you
made a fool of yourself but how it was that first time. You know the change 
from being straight or sober to being off your tits."
Rufus answered first.
"It was intense man. I mean not just the first time but the first few times
as it goes. Yeah, man. It was so different to anything that I'd experienced 
before. Very different from being sober. Very different. I see what you're 
getting at Alex. I mean I don't feel that any more. I kind of know what's going
to happen so it's not much of a shock or surprise. I still get loved up when 
take e's but it's not like it was those first few times. I mean even I take a
couple of tabs I can get close but not like that. Maybe they're cut or what-
ever."
"And where were you when you had those first experiences?", asked Alex.
"I was at my mate's house in Deptford. Yeah. There were four of us I think and
we started sort of mid-afternoon and then early hours the next day we were 
still quite high and only just starting to come down. But yeah, as you were
sayin before it was quite safe. I mean it wasn't a party just some mates 
together smoking weed and that and we tried some e. But yeah, it was quite an
intense experience. Maybe I wouldn't have done it at a club or at a party."
Rufus was looking a bit pensive and now swayed by Alex's position and was
thinking more about erring on the side of caution.
Alex looked at Betty and she recounted her tale of her first alcoholic
experience. 
"I was at a friend's house and I was in my early teens I guess. Their parents
were out and we were just watching TV and looking through magazines. Then the
girl who lived there asked if we'd like to try a drink. She said that she was
allowed one when they had their Sunday dinner or they had guests but only one.
There were only three of us, the girl who lived there myself and other friend.
We went downstairs to the sitting room and there was a table with lots of 
drinks on it. There were bottles of whisky and brandy and decanters and the 
kind of thing you see where people like a drink. My parents didn't have any-
thing like that. They drank but they usually bought something for the occassion
but didn't really keep stocks. I mean they do now but didn't then. So I hadn't
even seen anything like this before. Lea, the girl whose house it was made us
a cocktail each. She said it would be easier to drink if it was mixed and if
we couldn't taste the alcohol. She got some Coke and put some clear liquid in
it which I guess was Rum and put some ice in there. She said it was what her
mother would drink if they had guests. She handed us our drinks and said cheers
and bottoms up. Then she took a big sip. We looked at each other and took very
small sips. It was Coke but there was this strange taste that went along with
it."
Betty looked away for a moment and noticed the first star of that evening. She
wondered where the moon had gone. Wasn't it full moon, didn't that mean it would
be bright? She continued.
"I remember after I swallowed that there was a burning sensation. I mean it 
wasn't a strong sensation but tangible. I took another sip and I kinda liked it.
The other girl took a sip too. I guess there was enough Coke in there to mask
out the rum. Lea took a big sip as she was used to it or so she led us to 
believe. It didn't take us long to finish our first glass and we could feel the
effects more or less immediately. It was as Rufus was saying, quite intense. I 
had never felt anything like that before. I felt light and dizzy and giggly and
kind of strong as well. We took it easy and didn't take it too far. I think we
each had another one and that was all but it was enough to give us the effect.
I think we all liked it. We all giggled and played and ran around teasing each
other. But there was no harm done at all. There was no violence of any kind and
when the parents came home and saw us they just smiled. Nothing was broken and
we generally all had a pretty good time. The next few times were pretty much 
the same. But sure, I don't get that now when I drink, I know what to expect."
There was a short pause where no-one spoke and digested what had been said. 
Then Alex spoke.
"My first times were pretty similar. Fairly safe environments. Doing it with
friends, people that you trusted. And you both took sensible doses just to try
it out. No pressure to take it any further. You know. But there is another
danger that we haven't mentioned which is that the drug itself may not be pure.
I mean I've taken LSD which was contaminated with Strichnine and Extacy that was
mixed with speed. Even Cannabis that was mixed with Heroin. I mean 99 times out
of a hundred when you buy something that's what you get. But these dealers are
out to make money and if they can dilute it to increase their profit margins
they will. So there's that to consider", said Alex being cautious again. "I
mean that would be another reason to experiment in a safer environment than a
party or big gathering like this so that if you did pass out or whatever then
you'd be at home."
"I think you'll be alright. I mean I've taken stuff here and it's been fine
you know. But yeah, first time might be a bit intense, so I don't know." 
"I don't know either, but who knows when I'll have a chance like this again. 
It's an event like a New Year's party or something where people let their hair
down and party hard. And I mean I trust you guys: you'll take care of me if
anything happens so why not. Can you run those choices by me again?"
"You don't have to try these things. I mean just because everyone else seems
to be doing it. People eat deep fried cockroaches in China, would you try them
if you were there on holiday?", said Alex, still trying to dissuade her.
"Alex, I appeciate your warnings and I know I don't have to but I'm kind of in
a limbo at the moment and I could handle trying something new you know. I think
it would be fun. I'm a grown woman and I'll take my chances."
"Well, don't say I didn't warn you. Any of these drugs are pretty mindblowing
and much more so than alcohol. Add to that the possibility of contamination, 
loads of people off their heads and maybe the police turning up and you have a
 recipe for a nightmare", Alex was continuing to make his point.
"I don't know if I even want to go. Last time I went the music was shit and I 
just left after a little bit. But then I have been to some that have been 
really good. So I don't want to write it off altogether."
"Man, you're such a party pooper. Be positive why don't you. We'll go, get off
our nuts and have a nice time. And then we'll have another nice day on the 
beach. I mean that's it right. Easy." Rufus stated his case.
Betty listened to both arguments and gave judgement.
"OK, it's starting to get dark and chilly and we're getting into the evening. 
So we need to make a decision. I think I'd like to go and check it out either
sober or off my nuts but I don't want to go on my own. So it would be cool if
both of you would come. I mean if the music isn't good then we can all leave.
But I really would like to try something and with you two there with me I 
think I would feel safe enough. How about we go and get some dinner and then
head over to the bar to find where the party is at?" 
"We don't need to go there 'cos I know where it's at already", said Rufus
with a smug grin."One of them market geezers told me about it and I think he's
doing the music too. So I think it's all good."
"Oh, all right then", said Alex, "why not. I've never seen you off your face."
Betty gave Alex a peck on the cheek. 
"Cool. I'll go and get changed. See you both at the Mango Tree in 10 minutes?"
"Sounds good", said Rufus. Alex nodded.

It was actually a fairly warm evening with the occasional breeze. Alex was
suggesting that they didn't eat too much in case they felt sick. It did happen
sometimes. Rufus thought he was being over cautious of course. That was true. 
He was only doing it for Betty's sake. She appreciated the hand holding. They
all had a simple veg curry and rice along with a beer and some samosas on the
side. The party venue wasn't a huge distance away and really didn't require any
form of transport. It was a warm evening and the light of the moon made it seem
like day. They decided to walk. The streets weren't lit and even with the moon
it was hard to see holes in the road. There were often people coming the other
way along with cows, pigs and dogs. Sometimes they would see other ravers with
glowing necklaces or wristbands. Sometimes even a torch but that was rare. With
no tree canopy in places the road was bathed in moonlight. When one of them
stopped to admire the view the others did too. They were climbing up to a high
spot away from the beach and as well as the road itself they got a haunting 
view of the beach from up on high. The path was getting a bit gravelly and it
was a good thing that Betty had opted for her walking boots along with her hot
pants. She was starting to look more like a hippy each day. A t-shirt with a
plunging neck line and jaggedly cut at the sleeves, a bead necklace and even
her hair had a few thin plaits and some experimental dreads. Only one bangle
so far. The others thought about making a comment but resisted. She would see
it for herself soon enough.

Just as Betty started to wonder if they should have taken transport after all
they arrived at their destination. 
"Here we are folks", said Rufus,"doesn't look like much does it". They looked
around and saw more and more people arriving. The area was just a bit of 
clearing at the top of the hill. It looked a bit like a car park you might find
when venturing to the top of a monument. There were one or two vans and cars
dotted around. But the main form of motorised transport was scooters and motor-
cycles. Girls in their early twenties with large plasters and bandages on the
inside of their legs just below the knees: a telltale sign of their riding on
motorcycles. These were burns they had received from the hot engine against
bare skin. The fact that most people had these plasters made them feel a bit
less conspicuous but nonetheless it was a blow to their sense of fashion. Even
though they were hippies they still wanted to look good and look better than 
the next hippy and make it look effortless. Vogue had a way of penetrating all
walks of life. There were a few stalls too selling snacks, drinks and the usual
trinkets. There was always some money to be made. The stalls had light but other
than that there was only the light of the moon. At the far edge of this clearing
was a cliff and the party sound system was situated there. The decks were inside
what looked like another stall and either side on bamboo stands stood too very
large PA speakers. They looked fairly weather beaten but up to the job. The DJ
had the usual kit, a set of record decks, a mixer, headphones, microphone and
a box of records. They were in the process of doing tests and soundchecks. You
would hear a sudden loud phrase from a record followed by clipping and then a
hum. The dealers were already in force and could be seen moving from one group
to the next having a short conversation and moving on. Things were just getting
started.
"Kind of fancy a bit of mushroom punch tonight rather than e or trips. You know
keep things natural and that", Rufus said feeling in a holistic mood.
"Oh would that help you to connect with the atmosphere do you think?", asked
Betty half ironically.
Rufus got the joke but didn't respond.
"Nah, just fancy it that's all. Dunno, just in that kind of mood".
"You still want to do something Betty?", asked Alex.
"Yeah. I feel kind of quietly confident, you know, like I know it's going to be
a good night and I'm going to have a good time." Betty was trying to tone down
how keen she was and Alex was trying to hide how much he was concerned. He 
couldn't play the parent any longer and that being with them was as safe as it 
got for her. 
"Shall we get a drink or something?", asked Rufus, "pass the time while they're
setting up and that."
They walked over to one of the stalls and got three bottles of Thums Up. Sickly
sweet but it was cold. Just the thing on warmish night. They took a sip and 
could hear the sound of motorcycles nearby and in the distance. More people were
arriving. They wandered over to the DJ to see how things were progressing. They
didn't want to impose themselves but wanted to say hi and get an idea of the 
music for the evening. They gathered that the music was due to start in half an
hour or so and that there were three sets planned that evening each one lasting
about 2 hours. The DJ looked a bit nervous and complained about the equipment.
They walked just behind the DJ's stall and looked down over the cliff. It was a
sheer drop and probably not the best place to hold a party with intoxicated 
revellers running around. But that's how it was in Goa; everything was very much
at your own risk.

Rufus threw his empty bottle down the cliff. It hit the side and smashed into 
pieces. He pressed his lips together and raised his eyebrows and nodded. The 
others merely tutted. They moved away from the cliff edge and turned to find 
that numbers had grown significantly and that the previously empty car park was
starting to look more like a concert venue. There were some more colourful 
people amongst the gathering and also more light. There were some strung lights
near the edges of the car park rather like christmas tree light hung between
trees. But rather than tiny lights they had big light bulbs. It was starting to
look like christmas street decorations. Once the lights had been switched on 
there was a great cheer and the music started. Atmospheric trippy techno with
some familiar tunes elicited some whoops from the crowd. The DJ was from the
UK and made some general announcements and welcomes over the microphone. He 
reminded everyone that this was an illegal party as they didn't have an official
license and that meant it could be stopped by the police at any time. He told 
them that there would be three sets and very soon turned off the mic. The warm
up tunes continued but only a handful were dancing so far. Most were still 
milling around either looking for drugs or waiting for whatever drug they had
taken to take effect. Betty could sense this tension. It was like five to 
midnight on New Year's Eve. It was now or never. If she was going to be part 
of the crowd then she had to first decide that she did indeed want to try a
hard substance and secondly which one. She also had to decide soon. She opted
for extacy.

It didn't take long for our man Rufus to procure said substance in the form of
tablets. Alex looked at Betty once more and with a look that asked if she was
still sure about what she was about to do. Betty returned the look by poking out
her tongue at him and blowing a raspberry that was silent amongst the background
noise of the party. Alex leaned in and told her only to consume half a tablet 
rather than a whole one as it was her first time. But Rufus vetoed this warning
with his own reasoning that as it indeed was her first time she should embrace
that element by taking a full dose and experiencing the full force of it as the
first time could only be experienced once and only once. Alex had no counter to
that argument except to shrug his shoulders. Betty grinned as she reached for 
Rufus's open palm and take a small tablet between her thumb and forefinger. It
was about the size of an aspirin and almost the same shape with a relief of a
dove pressed into it. 
"These are quite pure as it goes," said Rufus, "not cut with speed or anything, 
so you'll be loved up but without all the running about."
Rufus was knowledgable on every drug that was in circulation and was also 
experienced in their usage. Unlike a GP he not only prescribed them but didn't 
require a textbook to have a knowledge of their effects, he had first hand
experience. Having listened to the label Betty unscrewed the lid from the top of
her water bottle and swallowed her pill. She then took a few more gulps of water.
"Usually about half an hour," said Rufus,"shall we try and find a nice spot in
case you need to sit down or whatever."
The plane was on the runway and the fasten seatbelt sign was on. There was no
turning back now. Rufus put his hand on her back and ushered her gently toward 
a clear area near one of the stalls. There were some hurricane lamps burning and
there was a small queue of people waiting for their omelettes and some other 
people sitting on the ground listening to the sound. Rufus nodded to the people
that were closest and pointed at the clear ground. They shook their heads to 
indicate that the area wasn't occupied. They all sat down on the small blanket
that Rufus had brought with him. The ground wasn't comfortable but at least they
had somewhere to sit and a sort of base camp to return to. Betty smiled knowing
that she ought not to take the experience too lightly. Even Rufus was now taking
precautions and he was the reckless one. Alex hadn't spoken in all this time but
now he too opened up his bottle of water and took a swig. She didn't see if he
took anything.
"Did you just take one too?", asked Betty.
"Yeah, exactly the same one. Rufus just had one as well. So we can be there with
you."
She saw Rufus wipe excess water from his lips. They were all on the same flight.
It was ready for takeoff and it was taxiing to the end of the runway. This time
she just said what she thought.
"Oh god, there's no going back now is there?"
Alex and Rufus both shook their heads.
"I've had these ones before," said Rufus, "they're pretty good and very smooth.
Quite rushy though when they come."
"OK."
More people were still arriving and there was a beautiful night sky revealing a
moon that looked much bigger and brighter than usual. As though it was closer 
to the earth. It wasn't crowded but enough to need to push past people if you 
needed to go anywhere. Such as the stall selling bottles of water which was at
the other side of the dance area. The volume of the sound system had gone up a
few decibels and Betty was both thirsty and in need of a toilet. Toilet first 
she though followed by water. But she didn't remember any toilets and she didn't
want to be parted from her friends when the drug would first take effect. She 
was sure that they would have gone with her but then they would have lost their
spot and she was already attached to it. She asked Alex if he had seen a toilet
anywhere but he shook his head and pointed toward some of the big rocks. He 
pulled a small torch from his pocket and gave it to her. She nodded and accepted.
With the brightness of the moon it was probably not even necessary but it was 
still very dark in the shadows. She only wanted to get far enough so she was out
of view but also close enough so she could rush back. She found a quite spot 
behind a large rock and found another girl doing the same. The girl stiffened a
little when she saw the torch light but then relaxed again when she noticed that
it was another woman. Betty turned off the torch and did her business. It was 
then she realised that she had no paper. One had to be self-sufficient in these
situations. Luckily the other girl had a small pack of tissues and handed her 
one. In a more conventional Western context they might have chatted before they
left their makeshift toilet but out here on a cliff in the darkness it didn't 
seem so appropriate. Betty hopped and skipped back to the blanket and to her 
relief saw that there were more bottles of water. She sat down to feel a slight
tremble. She wasn't sure if it was the depth of the bass sound or if she was 
feeling cold and shivering slightly. She could feel the hairs on the back of her
neck standing on end and then lower down her back. Then over her shoulders and
along her arms. Soon her cheeks were involved along with the rest of her face.
She looked across to the others and wondered if they were feeling the same and
if the drug was starting to take effect. Her question was answered momentarily
when those sensations of tingling and goose bumps began to spread all over her
body and doubling and trebling in intensity. Her whole body began to tremble
as though she had a fever and at the same time had just jumped into a very cold
water. But that was only her body. Her breathing grew deep and rhythmic. She 
began to breathe through the mouth just as if she were walking out of the cold
sea. Inside she felt the same kind of exhilaration that she felt at the end of
a run or after a swim but again magnified twice or three times. This was the 
rush they had spoken of. She reached out and took a man in each hand. Rufus with
her left and Alex with her right. She clasped their hands tightly and motioned
them to move closer. They understood what was going on as soon as they saw her
face and the breathing. Being veterans the two men didn't feel the rush as 
strongly as Betty but felt it all the same. They both looked at her as they each
felt their own rush and imagined their own first time. That feeling of newness
and that it was more intense than they had ever imagined. The feeling seemed to
intensify until all other aspects of her experience such as what she saw in 
front of her face, the sound of the music, the clasp of the hands all faded into
the background and the rushing sensation was stronger than anything else. As 
well as the physical aspect of the rush the feeling of euphoria and well being 
also grew to a great crescendo. Her breathing got stronger and deeper and she
felt as though both her physical and emotional heart would burst apart. The 
whole thing was rapturous and beyond anything she had ever experienced. It was
like all of her favourite moments were happening at the same time. Like the 
strongest and most prolonged orgasms she had ever had but magnified. The 
intensity climbed yet higher and she wondered how much higher it could possibly
go. She felt a glimmer of panic and looked at her friends. They beamed at her 
with big grins across their faces which settled her worries immediately and soon
she hit the peak of this so called rush. Slowly the both the physical and the 
emotional experience calmed to a level that was still very tangible and well 
above her normal everyday level of physical and emotional euphoria. She came 
back to her senses but with this added good feeling. She liked it to be being a
bit tipsy but with more of a clarity of mind than with alcohol.
"Told you you needed to have a whole one. You would have regretted it if you had
had only a half", said Rufus reassuringly. "What a rush eh. So nice."
Betty had stopped rushing but couldn't yet articulate any words. She leaned 
across and put her arms around his neck and hugged him. He stroked her back in
return and the back of her head. She pulled away and beamed at him breathing 
hard. He chuckled and nodded. Alex was smiling quietly and looking across. More
of a smirk than a smile. She turned and saw him then leaned over put her head
into his lap and put her arm around his waist. He patted her on the back and 
looked over at Rufus on his left and blew out some air. Betty soon got up as 
even though some extra contact was allowed under the influence there was still
a time limit after which things would feel awkward. The fact that Betty was 
aware of this in her current state showed both her friends and her that she was
not overwhelmed by the substance. She reached for a bottle of water and took off
the cap and took a long drink. The sensation of the water travelling down her 
oesophagus was akin to being massaged on the inside. She felt an urge to talk
about it but held back and simply enjoyed it.

It wasn't just Betty and her friends that were starting to feel the effects of
their ingested substances. Many of the other participants were feeling the same
way. One of the stalls was selling mushroom wine as they called it. It was a 
local hallucinogenic mushroom that had been steeped in honey for a year or so.
This was a traditional full moon party drink and for some of the revellers that
evening the drug of choice. Since they had sat down and noticed the numbers 
build steadily they hadn't noticed that there were many actually dancing but 
that had now changed. The DJ was well beyond his warm up tracks and very much 
into his set. The flourescent wrist bands could be seen moving rhythmically as
well as the tie dyed t-shirts glowing under the ultra violet lamps. People bared
their eyes and teeth to each other as anything white had the same demonic glow
which was decidedly trippy. Betty, Rufus and Alex all got up to join them in 
their gyrations. There seemed to be certain staccato movements that were favoured
by the crowd but there was no pressure to follow the trend. The ethos of these
parties and this music was that it was breaking with tradition and people could
experiment with a new way of relating to it. They weren't obliged to dance in
the way they might dance to other Western forms of music. But just like any new
trend it could easily start its own tradition and norms and conventions and soon
another new movement would be required to break away from that one.
