Just three days after anne died the funeral procession drove to the outskirts of 
the city. It was surprising how many had gathered at such short notice and 
during such difficult times. It was a traditional open casket service. The 
service proceeded quickly and the short speeches that were made were handled
sensitively. There was some laughter amongst the tears telling how Anne would 
often lead the way when others hesitated. Her hospital colleages made some of
the most moving eulogies. 

After the burial the parties all filed out of the cemetary, back into town to
attend the wake at a bar near Betty's parents house. They figured that those 
that weren't close family could attend the bar and then later on those that were
closer could continue on to the parents house. Only a few stayed on for their 
2nd drink. Not that they didn't want to pay their respects to Anne, they'd 
already done that by attending, but that they didn't really want to be around.
It was understandable I guess when you consider that the others were fairly 
heavy drinkers and if you wanted to be around them then you would need to be
a heavy drinker yourself. Betty and her fiancee were planning on getting drunk.
But that tended to be their plan most of the time. They had a little smoke now
and then but mainly it was alcohol. Jack and Farookh stayed on as well as some
of Anne's colleagues from the hospital.

The venue was Miller's Bar on 17th St. It was about four blocks from Betty's
parents, so not far at all when it was time to go to the after party. A lot of
the older folks had already gone home and Betty's parents remained mainly out
of politeness and due to the fact that they would be hosting the next thing.
But they were starting to get tired and around 11.00 decided to call it a 
night and said goodbye to everyone. They told everyone remaining that their 
house was available from then onwards for more drinks, snacks and conversation.
They waved as they left the bar and from those that waved back it was clear to
see how many remained. Steve's brother Eric had always had a crush on Anne but
never really did anything about it. Everyone knew about it and brought it up
sometimes. It had hit him hard. He'd thought that he would have all the time
in the world to find a way into her heart but now this. A few minutes later
he came out of the toilets wiping his mouth and looking very spent. He walked
straight up to Steve.
"I think I'm done guys", he said, looking first at Steve then at Betty, "I 
don't think I can handle much more. Probably need to sleep it off".
Steve stood up and give him a hug. They slapped each other on the back. Eric
give him a tight lipped smile and zipped up his jacket before heading towards
the door. He didn't wave to the others and just went straight out.
"Pretty cut up huh", said Bettty as Steve sat down again. "He always thought
that he was in with a chance. She liked him. She really did but she was 
married to the job. We all knew that".
"You got that right", said Farookh having overheard from the next table.
Aside from Betty, Steve, Jack and Farookh only one other person now remained
following Eric's departure and that was Helen. She was another paramedic who
worked with her on occassion. She was as dedicated as Anne and they just 
admired each other a great deal. They were great friends but didn't really
hang out much outside of their work life. I guess they didn't need to given the
amount of time that they spent together. The three of them found it strange to
out drinking together even though they spent time together like this many times
but never out of their uniforms and outside of the job. But this was a strange
situation but the company was familiar. Their minds seemed to flicker between
feeling comfortable and familiar to feeling that something was wrong and weird.
But they were also used to being thrown into crises and having to deal with it
fast and put their own concerns to one side. This was another kind of crisis 
which didn't involve any particular procedures or reaching for their medical
kits.

Both parties realised that they were the only remaining people so drew closer
to each other. Everyone was drinking from small glasses so it was clear that
it was hard liqueur all round. Betty addressed the whole group.
"How about one more drink and then we head over to my parents place? Whisky
or Tequila?" There was no option of no drink.
Everyone agreed to whisky as tequila was more about going out and partying and
this was a more sombre occassion. Betty brought the five small shot glasses 
from the bar herself without so much as a wobble. She dealt them out to each
person sitting and then raised her glass aloft.
"To Anne. To her courage and dedication." Betty made the toast.
They each raised their glasses and looked at each other without clinking. For 
a moment Betty felt a tremble pass through her and then everyone drank their
shot. The characteristic grimace followed the shot a second before the sound
of the glass being slammed on the table. 
"Shall we?", invited Betty.
They all stood up and got their coats. They all thanked the staff and waved 
before exiting the bar and heading toward nearest cab. Betty spoke again.
"Steve and I are going to walk as it's not far. It's four blocks or so and we
could do with a little air. If you guys want to take a cab I'll give you the
address. The others decided to walk too and made a group of three that was
following Betty and Steve closely behind. Betty lit a cigarette and put her
left arm through Steve's right. They smiled at each other but didn't really
say much. The three behind them just shuffled along. Farookh thought it was
rude as a guest to turn up empty handed so they stopped at an off licence
and bought a bottle of Jack Daniels. Betty and Steve waited outside while
they made their purchase. There was no need but they felt a sort of social
obligation to do so. Betty shrugged and didn't try and deter them.

When they arrived at the apartment building Betty showed them in and they took
the lift up to the third floor. It wasn't a massive apartment but you could 
see that it was big enough to have been a family home. As soon as Betty 
entered she could no longer hold back the tears. She found her mother after
the first sob. They clung to each other as they let the deeper low belly sobs
come out. They were a close family and they were quite open with each other at
least with feelings like these ones. This was not a time to be proud and stoical.
Betty's father ushered the others inside and took their coats. He offered them 
a place to sit and offered them food and drinks. Betty and her mother pulled 
apart and they started to put dishes of snacks onto the table, snacks that her
mother had prepared for the occassion. She could have bought them but it was a
way for her to focus on something practical and distract herself from what she
was feeling. 
"You OK Betty", asked Steve. Betty nodded while the others looked on without
turning fully.
"Be right back", she said. After going to the toilet she opened the door to 
Anne's old room and turned on the light. There was boxes in there now and also
things that were being stored but there were one or two things from when it was
still her room. She looked at the old pictures that Anne had put there but she
didn't want to linger too long with all the guests there. She turned off the 
light and closed the door.
Jack grabbed a handful of nuts and emptied them into his mouth as Betty came
back into the room. Steve pushed a chair out for her and she sat down and 
joined them. There were five sitting at the table and two were standing. Betty's
mother was still being the mother and going back into the kitchen getting drinks
and clearing things away. Habit of a lifetime that couldn't be put to rest even
in this dark hour. It gave her comfort in some ways. Betty's father wished that
she would sit down and stop fussing but she wouldn't and couldn't. Betty had 
offered to help but her mother was just far to restless to sit quietly and chat.
Helen was the other person standing but not for the same reason. She was looking
around the room and stopping to look at the photos while sipping on a vodka. She
was still inspired by Anne and was interested to know where she came from. There
were photos from all ages of her life dotted about the place. Every now and then
she would ask about a photo or an ornament to which either Betty or her father
would answer. Betty then asked her father to recount a tale of when Anne was 
about nine years old and she had saved a girl at school. Her father was a tad
reluctant as he had been holding back a little himself but figured it was a good
way to let out his pride rather than his grief.
"Come on Dad, you remember it better than I do", encouraged Betty.
"All right", he said and another sip of his whisky before starting to tell the
tale. Betty's mother came back into the room drying a ceramic oven dish and 
Helen turned around from her inspection of photographs.
"Even back then she liked to run and this was a training run with cross country
team. She wasn't hugely competitive but she thought that if she was around 
comptetitive people it would motivate her and help her to improve her running.
It worked. It was a good strategy and it not only helped her running but her
schoolwork too". He swilled his whisky round his glass as he paused for thought
and everyone waited for the next word.
"It was mainly open fields and tracks but this route happened to go through a
small wooded area just to add a little variety. There was a girl who was not so
great and trailing the pack and she tripped in the wooded part. Got her foot 
caught on a tree root. Well, she was going as fast as she could to try and keep
pace so you can imagine that she fell heavily and hurt herself. She hit her 
head and was out cold. Anne had noticed that she was struggling and was looking
back to check on her and saw quite soon that she wasn't there. She told the 
person next to her that she was going back to check and of course found this 
girl out cold. We knew she'd been reading books on first aid and was working on
her sling tying when she was at home but we thought it was just a doctor and 
nurse playrole kind of thing but she knew what she was doing. She put this girl
into the recovery position and blew her whistle. The girl had cut her head a 
little and Anne wiped the area clean with some wet wipes that she had with her.
I mean I don't know how or why she had all this stuff but she did and you can't 
really carry much when you're running. She showed us the little medikit that
she had put together with everyday things when she got home. All in a tiny 
rucksack". He took another big sip of whisky and refilled his glass and another
one.
"The runners all came back to the spot and the fittest one took a group and ran
back to the starting point to get help. The adult supervising the session told
her that she'd done well and was very glad to have a responsible person on the 
team. Anne didn't really care about the praise but that her 'patient' would be
OK. They weren't too far from the city and an ambulance arrived within half an
hour or so. The girl survived but it was Anne's quick response and action that
saved her. The ambulance crew could see she had potential doing that kind of
work and that it wasn't just a fluke or passing phase. There was a real sense 
of maturity in a girl of such a young age. That was the start really."
Her father closed his eyes for a moment and they could all see his eyebrows
knit together.
