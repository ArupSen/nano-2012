The morning after their wedding bleary eyed and wondering what had hit them Betty
and Steve placed their suitcases in the boot of their parents car. Betty's mother
was driving them to JFK for an 8.00am flight to Mumbai from where they would get
a connecting flight to Panjim in Goa. She had packed their bags while did their
wedding night thing and gently woke them when it was time to get ready. It was
the beginning of their married life and they were going on a luxury holiday to 
Goa on the West Coast of India. They had chosen it partly because Betty enjoyed
a great sunset and because it was a fashionable destination amongst their friends.

A moment after the thud of the passenger door the gas pedal went down gently and
Betty's mother Judy steered the car carefully to the end of the drive and out 
onto the road. It was Sunday morning and very quiet. Not a peep from the n
neighbours and even the birds seem to only just waking up. It was late summer
and just starting to get light. Although she didn't really need them the head-
lights were on just for safety. Judy turned furtively to check on the young 
folks. Sensibly strapped in for the ride and sunglasses to hide their bruised
brains. They were getting ready for the adventure of their lives. There was no
turning back.

It wasn't long before Judy had nosed the sedan onto a faster road and they 
cruised along without talking. Betty occasionally nudged Steve with her elbow
and pointed at something through the window. Judy glanced back now and then 
and asked if they were OK. They were children to her after all.

At JFK they found a luggage trolley and loaded their cases onto it. "You take
care of my little girl," said Judy with tears in her eyes as she hugged Steve
warmly. Betty and Judy looked at each other and said nothing for a moment as
they held back the tears. They hugged convulsively with an intermittent sob.
Each forced a smile as they grabbed the final pieces of luggage and walked 
toward the terminal doors. Judy wiped her eyes and waved feebly before getting
back into the car. 

The Air India check-in desk wasn't too far away and they joined the queue that 
was gradually building up. Any later and it would have been annoyingly long. 
Betty took off her glasses and looked at the tickets. Judy had packed those 
too. She smiled with a tight lip as she thought of her mother while they both
scanned the departure area. "Just you and me now," she thought to herself.

So far Trudy was the only one who knew about Betty's cancer after having it
confirmed in California. But she had to tell someone much closer to her. Her
husband perhaps. How would he take it if he told her? How would he take it if
she didn't tell her? She figured it would be worse in the long run if she 
didn't tell him. But just how long was the long run?

As they boarded their flight and found their way to their seats and packed the
hand luggage, she felt as though everyone knew that it was the biggest thing
on her mind and that Steve was the only person who didn't know. Could she not
hand the responsibility over to one of the other passengers or crew? He smiled
at her as he pushed the overhead locker door closed and sat down next to her.
"You got your book?", he asked.
"Sure, it's right here. How's your head?" she asked back.
"I'll live", he said, turning his eyes upward.
"I've got aspirins if you need. You'll probably sleep it off".
"Yeah", he said as they both started to absently fumble through their books
and start settling in for the flight.

They were newly married but they weren't all over each other as you might 
expect. They were both a little reserved in that department and came across 
more like a couple that had been long married rather than recently. As she 
thumbed her way to her bookmark she looked out of the window, staring more than
looking, thinking about when she might break the news. Did it have to be right
now? Perhaps she should give it a few days and enjoy her holiday first.  

Aside from the main meal and a movie they both managed to sleep their way
through the flight.
