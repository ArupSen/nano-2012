WC - 1375

The morning after their wedding bleary eyed and wondering what had hit them Betty
and Steve placed their suitcases in the boot of their parents car. Betty's mother
was driving them to JFK for an 8.00am flight to Mumbai from where they would get
a connecting flight to Panjim in Goa. She had packed their bags while did their
wedding night thing and gently woke them when it was time to get ready. It was
the beginning of their married life and they were going on a luxury holiday to 
Goa on the West Coast of India. They had chosen it partly because Betty enjoyed
a great sunset and because it was a fashionable destination amongst their friends.

A moment after the thud of the passenger door the gas pedal went down gently and
Betty's mother Judy steered the car carefully to the end of the drive and out 
onto the road. It was Sunday morning and very quiet. Not a peep from the n
neighbours and even the birds seem to only just waking up. It was late summer
and just starting to get light. Although she didn't really need them the head-
lights were on just for safety. Judy turned furtively to check on the young 
folks. Sensibly strapped in for the ride and sunglasses to hide their bruised
brains. They were getting ready for the adventure of their lives. There was no
turning back.

It wasn't long before Judy had nosed the sedan onto a faster road and they 
cruised along without talking. Betty occasionally nudged Steve with her elbow
and pointed at something through the window. Judy glanced back now and then 
and asked if they were OK. They were children to her after all.

At JFK they found a luggage trolley and loaded their cases onto it. "You take
care of my little girl," said Judy with tears in her eyes as she hugged Steve
warmly. Betty and Judy looked at each other and said nothing for a moment as
they held back the tears. They hugged convulsively with an intermittent sob.
Each forced a smile as they grabbed the final pieces of luggage and walked 
toward the terminal doors. Judy wiped her eyes and waved feebly before getting
back into the car. 

The Air India check-in desk wasn't too far away and they joined the queue that 
was gradually building up. Any later and it would have been annoyingly long. 
Betty took off her glasses and looked at the tickets. Judy had packed those 
too. She smiled with a tight lip as she thought of her mother while they both
scanned the departure area. "Just you and me now," she thought to herself.

So far Trudy was the only one who knew about Betty's cancer after having it
confirmed in California. But she had to tell someone much closer to her. Her
husband perhaps. How would he take it if he told her? How would he take it if
she didn't tell her? She figured it would be worse in the long run if she 
didn't tell him. But just how long was the long run?

As they boarded their flight and found their way to their seats and packed the
hand luggage, she felt as though everyone knew that it was the biggest thing
on her mind and that Steve was the only person who didn't know. Could she not
hand the responsibility over to one of the other passengers or crew? He smiled
at her as he pushed the overhead locker door closed and sat down next to her.
"You got your book?", he asked.
"Sure, it's right here. How's your head?" she asked back.
"I'll live", he said, turning his eyes upward.
"I've got aspirins if you need. You'll probably sleep it off".
"Yeah", he said as they both started to absently fumble through their books
and start settling in for the flight.

They were newly married but they weren't all over each other as you might 
expect. They were both a little reserved in that department and came across 
more like a couple that had been long married rather than recently. As she 
thumbed her way to her bookmark she looked out of the window, staring more than
looking, thinking about when she might break the news. Did it have to be right
now? Perhaps she should give it a few days and enjoy her holiday first.  

Aside from the main meal and a movie they both managed to sleep their way
through the flight. 

Arriving from a cold December morning in New York City the heat is quite 
noticeable when they exit the plane at Mumbai. There is a gentle breeze that
causes their clothes to flutter and they can feel it in their hair. It's warm
but not hot like summer in New York. But there's a smell that is quite 
unfamiliar to them. They walk down the steps to the terminal building and it's
it's like waking up inside a dream, especially as for most of the flight they
were asleep. Betty yawned. Steve smiled and put his arm around her.
"We're here. We're married. We're fucking married", said Steve.
"Uh huh," said Betty, "so we are".
"How long do we have till we get our connecting flight?", asked Steve.
"I think it's pretty soon. I remember we booked it that way so we wouldn't have
to hang around here for too long.", said Betty.
"Good plan", said Steve,"Do you have the documents?"
"They're in here somewhere", said Betty.
"I could really do with a drink", said Steve.
"Are you sure? We both had a hell of a lot last night. You not hungover or
anything?", asked Betty.
"Nope. And I didn't that much. I mean a little champagne and some wine with the
dinner. But that was all."
"Yeah, right. What about all those beers later on?"
"Ah. They're just beers. They don't count."
"OK".
Steve wasn't an alcoholic or someone who lost it when they were drunk. She 
didn't mind him drinking and could match him glass for glass when it came to
alcohol units. She knew that if he had a drink then she would probably have one
too and start talking. She wasn't ready to start talking just yet. But a drink 
would nevertheless be very nice indeed.
"I think I'd like a drink too", said Betty gazing at her imaginary halo.
Steve gave out sudden belly laugh that was infectious and Betty sniggered too.
They were being happy with each other but they weren't happy. It was all just 
one big show. Steve was angry with Betty for going off to California and taking
her problem to Trudy. He wasn't going to forgive her for that. And Betty of 
course had cancer. Two doctors independently of each other had confirmed it.
She couldn't pretend that it wasn't there. She so wanted to tell him but she 
was also very scared. Let's just enjoy being married and being the happy couple
and then the right time will present itself.

Inside the terminal building there was a very long queue. Now they wondered
whether it would have been better to have gotten a charter flight rather than
a scheduled one and gone straight there. They couldn't do anything about it
now as they had arrived in Mumbai. Bag searches, clothes searches, questions
and lots of x-ray machines that seemed old and defunkt. Could be a while till
they got their drink.
"How soon is that connecting flight?", asked Steve.
"I'll see if I can find the details while we're waiting". She looked down into
her handbag and thumbed through a few pages. 
"Ah, here we go. Oh shit." Betty looked grave, "Leaves in an hour". 
"Jesus, that's tight."
"But we booked these before September, so how were we to know it would take
this long."
"If we had waited any longer the price would have gone so much higher."
"And we wouldn't have got a seat anyways".
"True", said Steve.
"We'll make it and we can have a drink on the plane".
"I like your style Mrs. Turner".
Betty laughed again and picked up her bag as the line was moving.
"I could use a cigarette you know. That was a long flight", said Betty.
"I'm surprised you didn't mention it before", said Steve.
"Well, I had my chewing gum to see me through, but that isn't a real smoke 
though is it?"

There was just enough time after they had collected their luggage to have 
a smoke and then gradually make their way to the departure lounge for their
next flight. They were both tired and both smiling and they were both looking
forward to a drink. It was going to be a very short flight so as soon as they
were airborn and the trolley came past they ordered some hard liquor. Scotch
and soda. In an hour they could probably drink at least three if not more. 
For some reason they wanted to keep going. The flight attendants didn't care
as they were making money. The alcohol was starting to hit them and before
they knew it the plane was starting its descent and they were getting ready
to land. They were grinning now rather than smiling and teasing each other.
Passengers in the seats adjacent to them began to feel a little irritated
but that had always been their intention.

It wasn't long before they were sitting in the back of their taxi at Vasco da 
Gama Airport and heading toward their hotel. The Taj Exotica hotel an 
Benaulim Beach. They had chosen one that was both luxurious and away from the
usual revellers in the Northern part of Goa in Baga, Calangute and Anjuna. They
wanted an idyllic holiday that would be devoid of any undesirables as Betty 
liked to call it. She didn't like wasps on her dessert. Benaulim was certainly
quiet and they could not have picked a better time to visit Goa. The monsoon
rains had come and gone the vegetation was lush. The sun was shining but it
wasn't too hot and sea looked very inviting. They had also read that the 
Christmas time was nice there as it was a Christian part of the country. But
Steve was keen to return to New York for a family Christmas.

They started to unpack some of their things and put on their summer clothes.
When got halfway through the unpacking they decided to go out for a little 
walk. Explore the territory. Shorts and sandals on both of them and the small
amount of Indian currency that they had brought with them. They glided out of
the hotel leaving their key at the desk. Steve put his arm around Betty, his
wife and moved his hand lower and lower till it slipped beyond her waistband
and into her knickers. She smirked at him as they continued to walk and made
their way to the beach. The sound of the sea was very calming and drove away
their frisky feelings. The fidgety giggly nervous energy they got from the
alcohol was also fading away too. There was a half-moon but it was bright
enough to light their way and they saw others quietly walking along the beach
as though they were riding on a conveyor belt. They felt a sense of connection
with nature and their mood was deep but not pensive. The palm trees, the sand
and the gentle motion of the sea helped them to feel that they had indeed
arrived at their destination and that nothing could disturb their calm. It was
a million miles away from the chaos that was New York and even the few short
minutes of peace and tranquility was beginning to revive them.
