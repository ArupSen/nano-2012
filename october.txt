After her two weeks off Betty wants more time off to investigate what she has 
discovered. But Steve is not really a thinker and there have been cuts at work.
Betty goes back to find it's all very cutthroat.
WC - 

Two weeks had not been enough to explore her newly emerging inner life. A life 
that she didn't know existed. But it was also a life that no-one seemed to care
about especially her man. It obviously brought her relationship with him into
question. They had lived together for many years and she thought she knew what 
she was getting herself into but new evidence had come to light showing that
perhaps he was not the one. But she was not ready to pass judgement quite yet.
The nausea, headaches and cramps around her left breast had come and gone during
those two weeks but she had continued to ignore them and told herself that it 
was nothing serious and did not require any anxiety or attention. But she did
miss Anne. Even though they didn't see each other that often due to the nature
of her work, they were sisters and there was a connection that she would have
with no-one else. Anne lived from the heart and didn't care about the things 
that most people cared about such as money, social standing, family and being
successful which most people attributed to wealth. She just wanted to serve her
community and she let nothing stop her from doing that. She understood the 
fragility of life and she knew that there was no time for procrastination. You
had to live your life right now, this very minute as tomorrow it could be too
late. Each day she did her job rescuing victims of injuries she realised this
fact more and more deeply. It was now or never. For a lot of her patients it
had been a close call. If you got list of stuff you want to do in your life 
then damn well make a start, the dishes can wait she would say. You turn around
for a second and you could miss it. It was only now after her untimely demise
that Betty was starting to understand Anne's outlook on life. Now grieving her
sisters death she was realising that her very own sister had a vision of life
that was much closer to the truth than hers. Her own vision or philosophy was
one step removed from reality whereas her apprehended its true nature. This 
was why she was able to exhibit such fearlessness in the face of such trauma
and face it over and over again. Her life was dedicated to others and she took
her own life in her hands every day that she did her job. Most people take it
for granted that someone has to do the job of a paramedic and fly to the scene
of an accident and take charge of an injured victim. But for Betty it was her
own sister and she had been so proud of her. Now she had made the ultimate
sacrifice. She would remain ultimately blameless and pure but another unsung
hero that would soon be forgotten and other better documented ones would be
among the ones that are remembered. It angered Betty that Anne's life wouldn't
be recognised and that she wouldn't be celebrated as a great life in the halls
of history but that some corrupt politican due to their position in society 
would go down in the books. She thought of Anne as an anonymous philanthropist
whose contribution meant a great deal to the cause. This idea comforted her
somewhat but didn't stop her from being angry at the personages that would be
standing in the limelight for works of far less merit.

But it was time to put her grieving and reflections about life to one side in
order to back to work. She had already gathered that her department at Wells
Fargo were needing to make cuts to their staff especially after the trade 
center attacks and sending the city into an economic decline. Some of her 
colleagues had already been dismissed which left the others grappling to 
maintain their own position. This sense of self preservation and general self
interest put them on constant alert and the atmosphere was not as she had left
it. Everyone knew that further cuts were on the agenda and the workforce would
be further reduced over the coming months. It was the countdown to Christmas
and Thanksgiving which was sure to give their bosses a deadline in their minds.
The attitude was not only to make themselves look good but to make others look
bad. In fact they spent more time and effort in trying to make their co-workers
look bad. Gathering evidence of mistakes and anything that would weaken their
case when pleading to maintain their jobs. If the current workers could oust
the dead wood themselves then it would save their bosses the trouble of doing
so themselves, at least that was their theory. They had turned into hack
journalists digging up the dirt on sports personalities and celebrities in the
hope of getting a scoop. But they weren't after the scoop, only to see their
victim fall in the eyes of the public.

It was an environment that Betty had never witnessed in her place of work. There
a few nasty ones who would stab you in the back for no reason other than the
satisfation of doing so but now they were all at it. She would have to do the
same if she was to survive. But were there factions? Could she join one? She was
fresh meat even though she had been a high performer in the past. On her very 
first day back she could see the false smiles and her so called friends moving
in to dig the dirt. The first few days were easy as she was still nourished by
that carefree attitude that comes from having two weeks at home living at a 
leisurely pace. But by the end of the first week she too was getting worried
about keeping her job and keeping a tally of who was most likely to go next
and how best to send them over the edge. She hated herself for behaving in that
way but it was dog eat dog and if she didn't do it to someone else then sure 
enough someone was going to do it to her. This was something that Steve did
understand and was indeed willing to discuss. Betty once again connected with
him in a way that she wanted to connect on other levels too but for the time
being this would have to do. He seemed content that he was connected to Betty
again and that she was opening up to him. But for her it was all very superficial
and she knew that she would never be able to connect with him on things that 
matters most to her. But her survival at the office was important to both of
them so a certain amount of self interest drove his motivation to help. But he
genuinely loved her and he did care. 

The following week two people lost their jobs. One of them was indeed one that
Betty suspected would go soon and whom she believed she had toppled by showing
her bosses errors that they themselves had consealed. The one thing that the
workers in that department didn't know is how far the bosses were willing to
go. When would they stop? How far were they downsizing? The general consensus
was that the figure was cutting staff by 30% but it was only agreed estimate
and there was no evidence to back up this claim. Betty thought it was probably
more than this but couldn't figure out where this figure had arisen. Had the 
bosses circulated it themselves in order to quickly move through the first
round and then watch the remain workforce carefully after the infighting had
ceased? Others believed this too but not everyone. Nobody dared to find this
information for fear of being blacklisted by their colleagues. It was a police
state in miniature.

As October continued more of her colleagues left the department. They were 
mostly from the shortlist that were predicted to be leaving but there were also
some that left voluntarily. Certain of the voluntary redundancies were very 
surprising to her and to her current confidantes. One was the leader of an 
opposing faction who was declaring that they would never leave and no amount
dirt on their character would be enough to get them fired. What had happened?
Why had they gone that way? Probably a better offer elsewhere. It was to 
throw them off the scent while they were looking for work elsewhere. A very 
risky strategy as it was not only her company that was cutting back but most of
New York. Profits were down all over the city.

Whether it was the stress of the her work environment or another factor she 
didn't know but through October the symptoms that she had felt during the 
morning after the funeral returned with a force and vigour that were comparable
to the original. Perhaps even more so. On more than two occassions she quietly
went to the restrooms and vomited. If this got out to her colleagues it would
be another point against her. Headaches and dizzy spells and sometimes just 
feeling weak. It was hard work to pretend that it wasn't happening as this was
something that she really didn't need on top of all that had happened recently.
The pain in her left breast returned and sometimes felt so acute that even a 
full dose of painkillers wouldn't numb the pain. Was she pregnant? Was that the
reason? That would explain the nausea and vomiting. But what about the headaches
and the pain in the breast? The nipple was looking misshapen too. That surely
required the examination of a doctor did it not? She and Steve hadn't planned
to have children by having sex according to a calendar but as Betty was in her
late thirties they thought it best to move towards children gently but having
unprotected sex whenever they had sex. This took the pressure off them 'trying'
to have a child and possibly failing, as many of their friends had done and then
going through that disappointment. Or else getting pregnant very soon and having
to plan for the child before they had even got used to the idea. Their idea was
to simply have unprotected sex as and when their desires arose and if that sex
led to pregnancy then they would plan for the child but if it didn't then there
was still plenty of time for it to happen. But Betty hadn't missed a period since
her last one so this couldn't be a pregnancy. Perhaps a test kit would rule out
that possibility once and for all.

The pregnancy test kit that she bought showed negative. She bought another brand
and that showed negative too. She used the tests at home making sure to buy them
on the way home as pregnancy would be one big black mark against her and she 
could more or less guarantee getting fired. But in spite of her efforts to be 
discreet Steve found the test kit and confronted her. Over dinner one evening he
put the box on the table and demanded an explanation.
"What's this? How come this was in the trash?" asked Steve, trying his best not
to sound angry.
"It's a pregnancy test kit", said Betty trying to avoid the real question.
"OK, I can see that, I can read, but why is it in our trash?" asked Steve, this
time a little enraged.
"Because I put it there, OK. Does that answer your question?" said Betty raising
her voice and getting up from the table.
"Betty, what the fuck. When were you going to tell me about this? I mean if we
have children then we do it together. We talked about the whole thing together
and that we weren't going to try", he did bunny ear quotation marks with his 
fingers when he said try, "like most of our friends. Has something happened?
Are you pregnant? Betty, talk to me, what's going on?" Steve was feeling his old
insecurities again but now at least he had a subject that she might be hiding
and she also had a way to tell him something to appease him but still continue 
to hide. Steve had stood up but had now sat down again. Betty was in front of
the bathroom mirror looking at herself and thinking. Once she realised that 
this was a way to tell part of the truth she came back to the table and sat
down again.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you out of this. I know you're my man and
we're team and we're about to get married and we should talk about stuff like
this and anything we need to talk about. But ..." 
"But what?" asked Steve
"But when Anne died it was like I wasn't in a team any more. We had been the 
team, she and I. Even though we were doing our own things now the connection
was still there and suddenly she was gone. I just felt alone. So alone."
Steve was hurt by this comment but he let her continue.
"It was like we were kids again and I was a kid on my own. She was younger than
me but it was like she was the older one. She was the tough one. She was the one
who would take the risks and make the snap decisions. So I got to rely on her to
do that. Like I had deferred those responsibilities onto her. But she was gone
so who was going to do them now? Fuck. I'm sorry, this coming out like you're 
not in the picture at all, but it's not like that, you matter so much to me".
And he did, but right now he felt like the tiniest insect in her garden. She 
had wanted to open up to him but she knew that he wouldn't be able to take it.
He always needed to be reassured about being the centre of attention in her life.
Such an insecure idiot but she loved him anyway. Best to just tell him about the
test rather than explain why she hadn't told him before.
"I was feeling nauseous at work and threw up a couple of times and I thought 
that maybe I was pregnant so I got the test. The test was negative so I threw
it in the trash. I was a little disappointed to be honest and so I didn't tell
you. I figured that you would be disappointed too. I haven't missed a period so
I was thinking that I was probably wasn't pregnant but thought I'd just check 
to be sure. You see these things on TV don't you."
Steve had sat and listened while Betty had pleaded her case. Now it was his turn
to speak.
"I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have shouted at you or been angry with you. I know
it's been hard with Anne and all. But you know what I'm like when I get left out
of the picture. I'm so scared of losing you. I know I probably don't need to be."
"You don't need to be", replied Betty.
"I know, but I can't help it. It's just how I am. I'm paranoid and insecure and
I need reassurance. And I sure as hell appeciate that I can talk about that and
that it doesn't put you off."
"It doesn't, you know it doesn't".
"I love you Betty and I want to marry you and I want to have a family with you
and I just wish I could put these stupid fears and anxieties to one side but I
can't. I can't." He thumped the table gently but in frustrated way. "I don't
deserve someone like you".
"Steve, just stop it. This isn't going get us nowhere. Look at me. I love you
too. I mean it Steve, I'm not just saying it. And I want to marry you too and
have a family with you. I'm part of this fucking team. I can't do it without you
either." She reached across the table and grabbed his hand which was still balled
up in a fist. He unclenched it and let it relax. He blubbed a little and nodded.
"I'm here for you just as you're here for me. OK. Sometimes it's going to be
tough and if you work together we might just make it. What do you say?"
"OK. Yeah. OK." 
"Are you disappointed about the pregnancy or lack of it should I say?" asked Betty
"Yeah, I am. You were right to not tell me. But it's brought it home to me that
this is a real possiblity now rather than something that is far away in the 
future. It could happen soon." he said.
"Well, probably sooner than you think", she said with a slight grin," you wanna
go and try". She did the rabbit ear fingers as she said the word try.
Before Steve had had a chance to answer Betty had stood up and was drawing him 
towards the bedroom. He didn't protest but allowed himself to be led. He closed
the bedroom door behind him and at the sound of the door closing Betty could feel
that she was one step ahead again and getting some make up sex to boot.
