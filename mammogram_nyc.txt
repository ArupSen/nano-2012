As the symptoms continue and Steve has been alerted to the possibility of there
being a pregnancy Betty goes to the hospital
WC - 1270 

Towards the end of October when Betty was feeling more secure at work and also 
more secure with Steve she felt less secure about her health. The symptoms she
had experienced were still continuing and it she couldn't avoid them any longer.
It was time to visit the doctor. After a consultation with her local physician
he suggested a trip to the hospital for a scan. He didn't like the look of her
breast and even though she was below the median age range it was still worth
checking to see if there was something to worry about. Her doctor suggested
St. Vincents hospital but Betty told the doctor she would prefer to go to another
one even if it was further away. Her sister had died at St. Vincents and it was
also too close to her workplace. The second reason she didn't tell her doctor
but the first was enough for him to reconsider his suggestion. There was also
a third reason that she didn't want to run into Steve. It wasn't that she didn't
want him to know what was going on but only at a later stage when she was clear
about it first.

The appointment was for lunchtime on the 31st of October. Was that a bad omen.
Trick or treat? It was a hospital that she had never visited before. She had 
her appointment letter with her which she had had delivered to her office so that
Steve would have no chance of seeing it. The reception desk confirmed her and 
told her the way to the relevant department. The followed the signs along the
corridors until she found the waiting room. There were four people waiting there
all reading magazines and each of them looked up briefly before going back to
their magazines. Nothing happened. There was the sound of a page turning, the
occassional sigh and the sound of footsteps. When there was movement in or out
of the room all the heads looked in unison and dropped again when it was clear
that it didn't concern them. Betty was early and it looked as though the others
were before her in line. She was hoping to get back before her lunch break was
over but it didn't look as though that would be possible. A minute later a nurse
popped her head out from behind the door and mentioned one of the names. One of
the ladies nodded her head and went inside. The door closed and silence ensued.
Betty sat silently but she wasn't reading. She was trying to tell herself that
the waiting wouldn't last that long. Another five minutes passed and she found
herself reaching for the pile of magazines stacked on the table in front of the
chairs. There was one about exotic holidays. She thought about her honeymoon
which was only a month or so away. She flicked through it looking at the photos
and wondered how it might look in real life. The heat and the smells couldn't 
be captured in photos. That changed everything. And the poverty of course. Most
exotic locations were in deprived parts of the world and tourism was a big part
of their economy but it meant sucking up to their wealthy guests.

Two more people went into the room and there was now only one in front of Betty.
The queue was moving faster than she had imagined. Perhaps she would get back
to the office in good time and no-one would grow suspicious about her absence.
There were now four others flicking through magazines and finally the nurse 
came out and called out her name. Betty nodded, stood up and went inside. There
were two women inside. One was the radiologist and the other was the doctor.
The doctor greeted her and asked her to have a seat while she took some more
details. Then looked through the notes from her GP and asked her again about her
symptoms. She explained the procedure to Betty and she began to remove her shirt
and bra. The doctor examined her and took some notes. She tried to keep a poker
face and convey no meaning during this process. Then the radiologist helped her
to put her breast into the scanner and they both went out of the room for a 
moment while the x-rays fired. They scanned both breasts even though she had felt
pain in only one. From the appearance of the left breast and the nature of the 
nipple the doctor concluded that it was more than likely that she had a tumour.
There was no point beating about the bush as it would be delaying the inevitable
and it was better to know sooner rather than later so that treatment could be
started. The x-rays confirmed that there was indeed a tumour and that it was in
an advanced stage. The breast would need to be removed and there would be a 
course of chemotherapy following the mastectomy. But she would need to act very
soon before the situation got worse. The doctor suggested that she make an
appointment with an oncologist in order to discuss her options. She regretted to
have to bear her this bad news and was also sorry that she would have to usher
her out of the room to make way for the next patient. Betty was in shock. The
sheer disbelief was something that had been happening over the past month. First
911, then her sister and now this. Did she really have breast cancer? No, it was
too far fetched. It had to be something else. She got dressed quickly and said
thanks mechanically and left the room almost like zombie. 

What had just happened? She'd had her breast scanned and had been told that there
was a tumour and it was in an advanced stage and needed to be removed. It meant 
removing her whole breast and having chemotherapy. She went over it again as she
walked out of the hospital onto the street and hailed a cab. She sat in the cab
and stared out of the window. The driver was a chatty one and tried talking to her
but his voice seemed to come from a far distant place. He was a very jovial person
and kept up his monologue hoping to turn it into a dialogue. She nodded occassionally
and smiled but she wasn't really listening. In her mind she was listening to the 
doctors words over and over again. She was letting it sink in. It was as thought she
had gone there without cancer and had come home with it. Wouldn't it have been better
if she hadn't gone there? Perhaps then she wouldn't have cancer. Cancer at 35. She 
couldn't believe it. But it was her and it was happening. It may sound far fetched
but if you had told someone that a jet airliner would be crashing into the World
Trade Center they would not have believed you either. She didn't want it to be real
but it was real. How the hell was she going to keep this from her colleagues? They
would see that something was wrong. She could say that she was still upset about
her sister, which she was and had been to visit her grave. She wished that she 
didn't have to go through this kind of deception but that's just how it was.
