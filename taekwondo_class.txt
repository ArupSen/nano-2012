Betty reluctantly tags along to one of Trudy's regular Taekwondo classes. 
WC - 2967 

After their lazy Sunday in Santa Rosa and Betty's first swim at sunset the next
couple of days were spent following much the same routine for Betty with a run
in the morning and pastries from Captain Joe's. On one of the days Trudy made
lunch and they ate on the porch and on another Betty went to Captain Joe's as
she didn't want to disturb Trudy while she was giving treatments. Both of the 
days were clear and Betty went for a short swim at sunset. She was getting used
to the cold now. On the third day, which was a Wednesday was Trudy's weekly 
Taekwondo class. Trudy had invited Betty to come along with her but even though
agreed in principle she wasn't sure about it. She was convinced that someone 
would take the opportunity to kick her butt. Trudy tried to reassure her that
this wouldn't happen as there were kids there and if they got beaten up on their
first try then they wouldn't try again. But as she explained before there was no
watching: you had to participate. It was lunchtime and Trudy had just finished a
treatment and they were sitting on the porch.
"I mean even some mommy who's had a rough day with her kids bitching at her would
get some satisfaction whooping my ass to relieve her frustration", said Betty.
"Betty, it's not like that. It's not like in the martial arts movies where you 
have to prove your worth or show how tough you are before they take you".
"I don't know. I mean you've been going for a long while and you know what you're
doing and I'll be in the noob group and the new kid", said Betty exasperated.
"Betty, you don't have to go with me. I just thought it'd be fun if you came 
along. You've been all fascinated with my lifestyle so here's another way to get
involved. But I just think you'll have fun. But if you want to spend the evening
here alone be my guest, I won't get upset or anything." 
"OK, I'll think about it some more. Do I need to wear a special outfit?" asked
Betty.
"You do, but that's only for people who are a bit more committed. If you just 
want to try it out then you could just wear your running outfit." said Trudy.
"What about lunch?", asked Betty changing the subject.
"You wanna eat here or Captain Joe's?" asked Trudy.
"Captain Joe's", said Betty without hesitation.
"So what, you don't like my cooking?", said Trudy putting on a serious face.
"No. I mean yes, I do like your cooking. But I've been thinking about the crab.
I haven't tried the crab yet and I was thinking about it. Sorry, I know it's not
organic." Said Betty apologetically.
"Don't worry", said Trudy chuckling, "I was only teasing. Captain Joe's it is.
I don't eat organic all the time remember".
"If you're sure", said Betty wondering if she really had been joking.
"Of course I'm sure. Let's go".
They got Benjy and locked the door. Benjy ran off after a bird while Betty and 
Trudy trudged on the dry sand as the tide was higher today and they couldn't walk
on the smooth wet part. 
"I've booked the hospital appointment for you. The mammogram. The earliest I could
get was Friday. Is that OK for you?" asked Trudy in a matter of fact way.
"Yeah, I guess. I didn't realise you were doing that." said Betty.
"Well you said you weren't sure about it and I thought you might appeciate a 2nd
opinion. I'm sorry, I should have asked you first. I can cancel it if you don't
want to go." Trudy realised that she might have overstepped the mark.
"No, it's fine. Thanks. I mean it. It's a really nice thought and it will put me
back in touch with reality rather than trying to find the meaning of swimming at
sunset."
They were quiet for a moment and watched Benjy barking at the birds.
"I chose Friday because I don't have any clients and I could come with you", said
Trudy, "figured you could use a little support. I'm here for you but I don't want
to start making choices for you. I'm sorry if it feels that way".
"It's fine. It really is. I'd sort of forgotten about it, you know, put it to the
back of my mind. Like I was having a break from that too. But you're right, I 
came here to face it rather than run away from it. You did a good thing."
"So we're good?", asked Trudy a little worried.
"Yeah, totally. I'm really grateful." Betty took Trudy's arm. "You're a good 
friend". 
Trudy smiled, finally accepting that Betty wasn't angry with her.
They arrived at Bodega Bay and Captain Joe's diner. It was busier today than it
was the other day they'd come. But there was a table free and Betty ordered the
crab that she'd been thinking about all morning. Trudy had crayfish tails and a
salad. 
"How is it?" asked Trudy
"Mmm. Just as good as I expected. In fact better. This place is amazing. I'm 
going to work my way through the whole menu." said Betty.
Trudy laughed.
During their walk back to Trudy's house Betty agreed to go to the Taekwondo class.

They took Betty's car as Trudy didn't have one and went into Santa Rosa for the 
7.00pm Taekwondo class. Trudy was a regular and had been going for the past five
years. She had told Betty that she liked to train hard but Betty wasn't really
aware of what that meant. I guess that was what she wanted to show Betty. She 
had taken up martial arts training following her husband Gary's death. She said
that it gave her confidence but Betty wasn't really sure what that meant. The 
class was taking place in a basketball court and people were still arriving. 
There were at least a dozen childen with their parents and at least that many
adults. They all bowed when they came through the doors into the hall and then
greeted the people that they knew. There were plastic chairs around the periphery
of the hall where they sat down to take off their shoes and jackets. Some of them
took out bottles of water and sparring pads. Betty could see that in spite of the
discipline there was a friendly atmosphere and she began to feel more comfortable.
Trudy introduced her to the main teacher and told him that she was a beginner and
to take care of her. The teacher asked her if she had any injuries or had had any
recent surgery. Betty was placed in a group with the parents and for a moment she
rememebered her comment about being whipped my a mommy who'd had a bad day. There
were three groups with a teacher at the front of each. Trudy was in the advanced
group with the main teacher. The other two groups comprising mainly of the 
parents and the children were led by advanced students who had to teach as part
of their training. Trudy had to do that too sometimes as she had reached that
level.

The class started with warm ups and all three groups ran around the room. Betty
found his part easy. They had to run forwards, backwards, sideways and change
direction. After a few minutes of that they got into pairs and worked on some
stretching movements. Betty did this sometimes after her run but not often. She
knew that it was something that she ought to do but she was usually in too much
of a rush in the morning to do it. It was painful but her partner was friendly
and didn't push too hard. After that they got into rows and went through some
basic movements. First there were punches then kicks and then blocks. Betty did
her best to keep up with the alien gestures. Next came short combinations and a
turning movement when they reached the end of the room. Then they got into pairs
again. Betty paired with the same woman with whom she'd stretched. They bowed 
to each other and started to work on some attack and defence combinations. First
one would play the role of the attacker then the other. Each combination was
carefully coreographed and as well building on the smooth flow of the movements
they were also working on the timing and correct breathing. The teacher for her
group came close up to Betty and guided her hands through the movements. They
worked on three combinations in all after which it was time for some pure physical
training: push up and sit ups and squatting with a partner on your back. Betty
found this pretty tough but glancing over to Trudy's group she saw them doing
push ups on their finger tips and squatting on one leg while holding the other
one in front of them. Perhaps what she was doing wasn't so tough after all.
After the exercises the main teacher spoke for a moment. He said that as there
was a competition coming up soon for the weeks leading up to it they were 
focusing their efforts on competition training. The next part of the class was
the free sparring. Some people especially those who would be going for the
tournanment were putting on their sparring pads. The teacher for Betty's group
explained that the sparring was full contact or no contact. The tournament was
full contact which was why they had their pads. As well the sparring that was
taking place some of the class were also practicing their kata. This was like
a solo dance sequence and resemled the staccato movements of tango without a
partner. Betty worked with the teacher for her group to learn the first part
of a beginners sequence. She preferred this to the sparring. It took a great
deal of concentration. She watched the children going through their katas and
it was beautiful to watch. She wondered if she would be taking her children to
a martial art class. But then she wondered if she would even be having children
or even being alive in a few years time. For a moment she was gripped by this
feeling and then looked around the room to find Trudy. Trudy was working with
full force against a partner holding up some very thick pads. She was working
on a spinning kick. She was landing the kick every two or three attempts and
cursing each time she missed. Each time she did land the kick the thud of her
foot against the pad echoed around the hall in unison with primal shout that
came from deep within her. Betty turned back to her to own task and thought
that she wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of that kick. She turned 
around again to the sound of clapping when she saw the pad holder lying on
the floor and Trudy with her arms in the air. Trudy was one of the hopefuls
for the tournament and representing the club meant a lot to her. They did some
more sparring and kata until the main teacher called a halt. The whole class
stopped immediately. It was time for the cool down. They did a few gentle
stretches but this time it was done solo. Then they all sat down in a kneeling
position to meditate. It was hard wooden floor which wasn't at all forgiving
to the shins but the group leader told her that it would be very short and
shouldn't be a problem. She looked at the children kneeling in rows and 
followed suit. The main teacher gave instructions. They had to place their 
palms flat on their thighs and close their eyes. Then they breathed in a 
rhythmical way and counted their outbreaths up to ten. The teacher asked them
to focus their attention on the tip of their nose and to feel the sensation of
the air. All that Betty could feel was the pressure of the floor against her
shins. At least it helped her to concentrate. They all opened their eyes slowly
and then stood up. Betty felt pins and needles throughout her shins and feet.
They were all silent for a moment then the main instuctor bowed and the class
bowed in return. Then the two junior instructors bowed to the senior who bowed
back to the them. Everyone then clapped to finish the class in a more Western
manner. Trudy came over and patted Betty on the back.
"Let's go get some food, I'm starving", said Trudy.
"Yeah, me too", agreed Betty.

They went to the same wholefood bistro where they had been a few days ago for
their lazy Sunday afternoon. They ordered tofu burritos with aduki beans and
pumpkin.
"So you liked it then?", asked Trudy with a mouthful of tofu.
"Yeah, I did. I figured I would get bored about halfway through but seeing the
kids doing it and the difficult stuff that your group was doing was really very
inspiring."
"Did any moms whoop your ass?" asked Trudy.
"No. Not at all. They were really nice. You were right. I had a nice time. I'm
glad you persuaded me to come."
"That's great. I'm really glad you enjoyed it." replied Trudy. "We have this
tournament coming up soon so we can't miss any sessions at the moment. They're
rootin for me to get to the ladies finals this year as I got pretty close last
year. It's in December though so I'm guessing you'll be back home by then".
"Wow. I didn't realise you were so dedicated. You hit that pad real hard. I don't
think I'd like to be the one holding it" said Betty looking Trudy in the eye.
"It gives me a way to channel my agression and sort of keep it bottled up for 
when I need it."
"Did you ever need it? I mean did you ever have to defend yourself in real life
I mean?" asked Betty.
Trudy took a sip of her drink before replying.
"When Gary died he was defending our house. He tried his best but he wasn't a 
fighter and he got beat up pretty bad and died of his injuries. I felt so fucking
helpless. Like a stupid bimbo who stands back and watches and shouts his name. 
If I had the skills that I have now I could have taken that guy easy. I woulda
cracked his ribs and snapped his arms". Trudy looked away for a moment.
Betty shuddered when she saw this side to Trudy but seeing your husband getting
beaten to death can't be easy for any woman. She felt awkward and didn't know
what to say. Trudy started staring at her food but not eating it.
"What happened to the attacker?", asked Betty, "did they get him?".
"Yeah, they got him", sighed Trudy, "but he's only got five years or so. The 
sentence was brought down by some technicality and he won't serve out the whole
term due to good behaviour on the inside. Reckon he'll be out soon."
"Trudy, you're not thinking . . ." asked Betty.
"Yeah, I am. It's been on my mind a lot. I'd give it my best shot and if I didn't
make it ... " she trailed off. "Gary's gone. This guy doesn't have a right to be
here while my Gary is gone."
"Trudy you're scaring me. Are you serious?" asked Betty a tad disturbed.
"I'm totally serious. That guy took away the most precious thing I had and now I 
have nothing. All this stuff I do is only to retain my sanity. I've imagined 
killing this guy so many times over. It's the only thing that keeps me going. And
now I might get to do it for real."
Betty was silent. Her quiet and calm friend who was helping her through her own
troubles had troubles of her own and perhaps they were troubles that she was not
ready to hear. They were both quiet for a moment but continued to eat.
"Sorry Betty, I didn't mean to scare you. That was the one and only time when I've
had to defend myself for real but it was already too late. Don't worry Betty, I'm
not going to go chasing after this guy, that's just me being angry. Sometimes I 
miss Gary so much and would easily trade places with him. It all just seems so 
meaningless without him. But I'm trying, I really am trying". Trudy closed her
eyes and held back the tears. 

They got up to leave a moment later and went straight back to Trudy's house on
Dillon Beach. The house where they had been attacked by a burglar and the house
that Gary had tried to defend. Trudy realised that she had scared Betty and had 
lost a little trust but she also knew that she was unstable especially now that
the attacker was about to be set free. Walking the streets to commit more crimes.
Sometimes the urge to track him down and kill him was so strong that it took all
her strength to stop herself from carrying out such a plan. She told Betty that
a wound like that didn't heal overnight and would probably never heal but she 
was doing her best. Betty had come to be somewhere safe where she could relax
and share her troubles and didn't need to be with a crazy lady out for revenge.
