We begin the novel with a bang - the attacks on New York on September 11th 2001.
Anne Klein is a paramedic finding victims of the explosions and people buried
under the rubble.

10.00 am on Wednesday September 12th 2001. Anne placed a face mask over another
unknown victim of the attacks. They were all covered in the grey dust that 
permeated the atmosphere. This one was was a survivor but barely conscious. She
and her colleague Jack heaved the stretcher up the the two steps into the 
ambulance and closed the doors. Jack slapped hard on the panel and shouted,
"Let's go".
The driver put the vehicle into drive and they sped up to slow cruise. With dust
and debris on the road and grey snow falling they couldn't drive at their normal
speed.
"Pulse is weak on this one", said Anne, "should we give her a shot?"
"I don't know, she may go into shock if she wakes up", said Jack, "we don't have
far to go".
They soon arrived at St. Vincents and heaved the new patient out of the vehicle.
They put the stretcher onto a gurney and the hospital staff took over. 
"I need the bathroom, be right back. Don't leave without me", said Jack trying
to put some humour into it.
Anne and the driver Farookh both tutted but also realised what he was trying to
do. Anne lit a cigarette. She blew out hard after her first puff. Farookh got 
back into the drivers seat and waited with the engine idling. About halfway
through her cigarette Anne felt her hand shaking and held it steady with her
other hand. She looked around quickly to see if anyone had noticed that she had
done that. But they were all too busy. Their job was to think about others and
not to worry about themselves and that was what they did. She took one more puff
and saw Jack rushing back with a fast walk.
"Did you wash your hands?", asked Anne.
"No, we don't have time for hygeine", answered Jack.
"Men!", said Anne, "you're all such pigs". She checked her medi kit and nodded.
"All set?", asked Jack, "OK, let's hit it".
As soon as they had closed the door the ambulance was reversing back out onto the
main street and then back into the grey snow and the trade center buildings. This
time the visibility was better and they drove a little faster. They were wearing
dust masks and preparing themselves for more bodies.
"About as close as we can get", shouted Farookh leaning back and turning his head
to the right. He waited while Jack and Anne got out and found their way through 
the rubble to where the firemen were working. They were squinting and waving away
the air directly in front of them whilst carrying their medi bags in other hands.
"You got any more for us?", asked Jack. 
"Some more live ones that way", the fireman pointed them in the direction of 
another group of firemen a few feet away.
The whole place had a sort of eerie silence and was yet so loud. A sound that 
couldn't be avoided. But one they had to shut out in order to do their job. Anne
coughed.
"When are you going to quit smoking?", said Jack, "you know those things'll kill
you."
"Thanks for the warning Mr. Surgeon General", she said just after recovering from
her cough."Be sure to attend my funeral", she said again with a Southern drawl.
When they had navigated their way through the rubble and big chuncks of concrete
they spoke to the group of firemen.
"Got any live ones?", asked Jack hopefully.
"I think they're gone", replied the fireman pointing down to a group of four 
bodies they had unearthed. "You best check them to make sure".
Three middle aged women and one man all covered in dust and wearing business 
clothes. Anne and Jack nodded gravely and took out their stethoscopes. Anne 
checked the two women closest to her. Nothing. No pulse or heartbeat. Shit. Jack
checked the other two. The man was gone but the woman had a faint heartbeat. 
"This one is still beating but only just", said Jack,"Let's get the stretcher".
They walked back to the ambulance to fetch the stretcher.
"You find any more survivors?", asked Farookh.
"Yeah, we got one. Be right back." Anne didn't want to mention the dead ones.
They loaded the womans body onto the stretcher and carried her back to the 
ambulance.
"This one's a bit lighter than that last one", said Jack.
"Yeah, quite a lot."
With the patient loaded Jack rapped on the ambulance wall again to signal them
to go. Farookh turned on the siren and they were heading back up 8th Avenue to
St. Vincents. The hospital was filling up fast and they were having to discharge
as many as they could in order to free up beds. But they didn't need one for 
this latest patient. The faint heartbeat got fainter and fainter till it was 
gone. They arrived with a corpse.
"Shit", said Anne and threw the swab she was using to wipe the dust from the
patients face. She turned away to face the inside wall of the ambulance and 
breathed hard a mixture of anger and sadness. She could feel it welling up but
felt it pass away as she breathed again.
Jack breathed out long and slow. A worried and confused look on his face. They
just had to go on. 
Farookh got out of the vehicle and streched his back. The others got out of the
back and caught his eye and shook their heads. His shoulders hunched. Another
moment of defeat but he knew there were more survivors to be found and wasn't
giving up just yet.
"This one died on the way", said Jack as he handed the body over to the staff
at the hospital."Should we bring the other bodies?"
"It's a tough call but we need stay focused on the live ones", said the doctor.
