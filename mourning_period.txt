The period immediately following Anne's death. Betty is allowed one week by her
employer. This scene takes us up to the first hospital visit.
WC - 

Betty spent the rest of her week off doing much the same as that Monday. She 
started the day with a long bath followed by a run, breakfast in the park or in
a nearby cafe and some shopping on the way home. She had been given one week of 
paid leave and her boss had been kind enough to allow her to take more time if
she needed as unpaid leave or use some of her holiday allowance. Stocks had taken
a dive and she was wondering if this compassion was just a front to sweeten the
blow when it came to letting her go. She was a good worker but there were many 
like her where she worked: perhaps it was time to trim the fat. She was required
but not indispensible. She hadn't reached that level of responsibility just yet.
She was close but not close enough. The last time she'd had a break like this was
when she was at university, having the whole day to herself and deciding when she
would do what. It took a little discipline on her part but the rewards were worth
it so long as she didn't get too distracted. The day was a small unit of your 
whole life and if you could steer your way through the day doing what you wanted
and creating an atmosphere that was conducive to the way you saw the world then 
that was a day lived well. If the rest of your days could be like that then that
was a good result. Betty wondered why these were the only times when people with
regular jobs and careers got time off like this. When they were sick or when they
had children or a bereavement. They had paid holiday time of course but that 
usually entailed going off to some other destination to get away from the usual
day to day and enjoy the luxury of something that couldn't be had at home. It 
then involved coming home and sharing those tales with friends and colleagues. 
But the main activity of life was work with only a few short interludes. Even 
weekends involved doing home admin, housework and a little social interaction. 
It was often social obligation rather than purely fun. How about a week that was
an extension of a weekend she thought. Going to the museum, the cinema and taking
time reading the newspaper at a cafe. The kinds of things that most people did 
at the weekend but repeated over a whole week. Three weekends in a row. After the
activities were exhausted of interest they would become vehicles to create a 
sense of structure and routine now that there was no 9-5 work period to give that
structure. And once the activities became banal and empty then the real yearning
that underlies our day to day can come up to the surface and we have time to
examine it in a controlled environment called the week-weekend. A mini sabbatical
if you like where we can gauge our own plans and desires against that of the 
collective. Do we fit the profile of the American dream? Do we really want kids,
better career and a family life? People in better paid jobs can look down on 
those that work on the factory floor and rejoice in the fact that they are not
thoughtless automatons working from hand to mouth and locked in a state of affairs
where no amount shifting the goal posts can change their situation. They had 
enough money to enjoy a certain amount of leisure and to consume luxury goods
but that still meant being tied to their career. They were valued workers hired
for their skills and trusted with decisions. But even though they were higher up
the scale than the average labourer they were still only a small part of something
that was much bigger and needed to be kept silent. The better pay, the access to 
more affluent leisure pursuits and the ability to live in sought after location
all made it seem to them that they had made something of their lives but were 
they just part of a collective over which they had very little control?

Betty allowed these thoughts come up in her mind and tried not to accept or reject
them while she spent her week creating a week-weekend for herself. She wondered
if new mothers spent their days in this way but looking after the baby would take
up all or most of their time. I guess a nanny would help she thought. After her
run and cafe for brunch, newspapers and reflection she would get a few things for
the evening meal and take her time preparing it. This wasn't something that she 
did in the past even at the weekend but she was enjoying and Steve was appeciating
it too. He was wondering if that would be the way of things when they were 
married. But they had been living together for a few years so why would anything
change just because they were married. There was another social convention. Even
though many couples live together all their lives without even thinking about 
getting married for some reason as soon as they did get married even though it
was just a piece of paper things did change. It wasn't just a continuation of 
living together as they had been, there was a much stronger bond and people 
perceived them differently too. Attitudes had changed over the years but not in
this respect. Why did Steve who was a forward thinking kind of guy start to 
imagine that his future wife would start preparing the evening meal on a regular
basis once they were married? That idea had been wired into his psyche somewhere
along the line and he obviously hadn't noticed. But at that moment as Betty was
serving him his plate of food he caught hold of his train of thought and stopped
himself from saying it before he did. Betty noticed that something was amiss and
quipped about it.
"Oh I'm sorry dear, let me pour your wine", said Betty filling his glass with
the air of the perfect 50's housewife. "Look at the kitchen darling, isn't it
so clean? And I made cupcakes too." 
Steve stared at her open mouthed and wondered if she had heard him thinking. He
was about to mention it but just said thanks and sipped his wine playing along
with her parody. It was the end of the week of compassionate leave and Betty was
wondering if she should take another week. Once she had served herself and sat
down she put joking aside and began to tell Steve about the week that she had
had and he listened intently.
"I like doing the housewife thing but I don't think I could keep it up for very
long. I love my work and I love the routine it gives me. But it has been a 
useful time for me just to drop everything for a while. You know, I've been 
calling it a week-weekend. I've tried to make the week like an extended weekend.
We're used to just putting our feet up for a weekend and taking in a little R &
R but if we have a longer break then we try and organise something, you know,
like a trip or something. It did cross my mind but I just wanted to be here at
home and just have that weekend feeling. I mean it's like a short-term mental
illness. I guess that's how the industry would see it. When their workers are 
bereaved they possibly consider it like they're sick and then at some point they
are well again and come back to work. It's a cold economic way of putting it but
paid leave costs a company money. Anyway, it was nice to feel like a tourist in 
my own city, seeing everyone else doing their day to day things and while their
weekend was over mine was continuing. I'm wondering about the idea of taking one
more week. It would be unpaid this time though as we've got the honeymoon coming
up pretty soon."
Steve put down his fork and reached across to put his hand on Betty's arm.
"You take as long as you need. There is no finite amount of time for this process.
You think it's all done and you feel you can go on with your life and then you
realise that it's not over at all." Steve wasn't talking about Betty any more but
he was still on point.
"I think I will you know. I haven't had a break like this in a long time and even
though I am actually missing work a little, can you believe that, just a few more
days should see me through. Then I'll be able to carry on with the daily grind."
"Sure. Yeah. Good idea. You can always call me at work if you need to talk. I'm
not always available but I mean if something comes up and you just need to mull
something over, you know, I'm there for you." He was still feeling left out of
her inner life but less so than before.
Betty nodded and thanked him. But they had the evening to talk but usually by 
then her time for reflection had passed.
