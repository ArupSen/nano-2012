The period immediately following Anne's death. Betty is allowed one week by her
employer. This scene takes us up to the first hospital visit.
WC - 1604 

Betty spent the rest of her week off doing much the same as that Monday. She 
started the day with a long bath followed by a run, breakfast in the park or in
a nearby cafe and some shopping on the way home. She had been given one week of 
paid leave and her boss had been kind enough to allow her to take more time if
she needed as unpaid leave or use some of her holiday allowance. Stocks had taken
a dive and she was wondering if this compassion was just a front to sweeten the
blow when it came to letting her go. She was a good worker but there were many 
like her where she worked: perhaps it was time to trim the fat. She was required
but not indispensible. She hadn't reached that level of responsibility just yet.
She was close but not close enough. The last time she'd had a break like this was
when she was at university, having the whole day to herself and deciding when she
would do what. It took a little discipline on her part but the rewards were worth
it so long as she didn't get too distracted. The day was a small unit of your 
whole life and if you could steer your way through the day doing what you wanted
and creating an atmosphere that was conducive to the way you saw the world then 
that was a day lived well. If the rest of your days could be like that then that
was a good result. Betty wondered why these were the only times when people with
regular jobs and careers got time off like this. When they were sick or when they
had children or a bereavement. They had paid holiday time of course but that 
usually entailed going off to some other destination to get away from the usual
day to day and enjoy the luxury of something that couldn't be had at home. It 
then involved coming home and sharing those tales with friends and colleagues. 
But the main activity of life was work with only a few short interludes. Even 
weekends involved doing home admin, housework and a little social interaction. 
It was often social obligation rather than purely fun. How about a week that was
an extension of a weekend she thought. Going to the museum, the cinema and taking
time reading the newspaper at a cafe. The kinds of things that most people did 
at the weekend but repeated over a whole week. Three weekends in a row. After the
activities were exhausted of interest they would become vehicles to create a 
sense of structure and routine now that there was no 9-5 work period to give that
structure. And once the activities became banal and empty then the real yearning
that underlies our day to day can come up to the surface and we have time to
examine it in a controlled environment called the week-weekend. A mini sabbatical
if you like where we can gauge our own plans and desires against that of the 
collective. Do we fit the profile of the American dream? Do we really want kids,
better career and a family life? People in better paid jobs can look down on 
those that work on the factory floor and rejoice in the fact that they are not
thoughtless automatons working from hand to mouth and locked in a state of affairs
where no amount shifting the goal posts can change their situation. They had 
enough money to enjoy a certain amount of leisure and to consume luxury goods
but that still meant being tied to their career. They were valued workers hired
for their skills and trusted with decisions. But even though they were higher up
the scale than the average labourer they were still only a small part of something
that was much bigger and needed to be kept silent. The better pay, the access to 
more affluent leisure pursuits and the ability to live in sought after location
all made it seem to them that they had made something of their lives but were 
they just part of a collective over which they had very little control?

Betty allowed these thoughts come up in her mind and tried not to accept or reject
them while she spent her week creating a week-weekend for herself. She wondered
if new mothers spent their days in this way but looking after the baby would take
up all or most of their time. I guess a nanny would help she thought. After her
run and cafe for brunch, newspapers and reflection she would get a few things for
the evening meal and take her time preparing it. This wasn't something that she 
did in the past even at the weekend but she was enjoying and Steve was appeciating
it too. He was wondering if that would be the way of things when they were 
married. But they had been living together for a few years so why would anything
change just because they were married. There was another social convention. Even
though many couples live together all their lives without even thinking about 
getting married for some reason as soon as they did get married even though it
was just a piece of paper things did change. It wasn't just a continuation of 
living together as they had been, there was a much stronger bond and people 
perceived them differently too. Attitudes had changed over the years but not in
this respect. Why did Steve who was a forward thinking kind of guy start to 
imagine that his future wife would start preparing the evening meal on a regular
basis once they were married? That idea had been wired into his psyche somewhere
along the line and he obviously hadn't noticed. But at that moment as Betty was
serving him his plate of food he caught hold of his train of thought and stopped
himself from saying it before he did. Betty noticed that something was amiss and
quipped about it.
"Oh I'm sorry dear, let me pour your wine", said Betty filling his glass with
the air of the perfect 50's housewife. "Look at the kitchen darling, isn't it
so clean? And I made cupcakes too." 
Steve stared at her open mouthed and wondered if she had heard him thinking. He
was about to mention it but just said thanks and sipped his wine playing along
with her parody. It was the end of the week of compassionate leave and Betty was
wondering if she should take another week. Once she had served herself and sat
down she put joking aside and began to tell Steve about the week that she had
had and he listened intently.
"I like doing the housewife thing but I don't think I could keep it up for very
long. I love my work and I love the routine it gives me. But it has been a 
useful time for me just to drop everything for a while. You know, I've been 
calling it a week-weekend. I've tried to make the week like an extended weekend.
We're used to just putting our feet up for a weekend and taking in a little R &
R but if we have a longer break then we try and organise something, you know,
like a trip or something. It did cross my mind but I just wanted to be here at
home and just have that weekend feeling. I mean it's like a short-term mental
illness. I guess that's how the industry would see it. When their workers are 
bereaved they possibly consider it like they're sick and then at some point they
are well again and come back to work. It's a cold economic way of putting it but
paid leave costs a company money. Anyway, it was nice to feel like a tourist in 
my own city, seeing everyone else doing their day to day things and while their
weekend was over mine was continuing. I'm wondering about the idea of taking one
more week. It would be unpaid this time though as we've got the honeymoon coming
up pretty soon."
Steve put down his fork and reached across to put his hand on Betty's arm.
"You take as long as you need. There is no finite amount of time for this process.
You think it's all done and you feel you can go on with your life and then you
realise that it's not over at all." Steve wasn't talking about Betty any more but
he was still on point.
"I think I will you know. I haven't had a break like this in a long time and even
though I am actually missing work a little, can you believe that, just a few more
days should see me through. Then I'll be able to carry on with the daily grind."
"Sure. Yeah. Good idea. You can always call me at work if you need to talk. I'm
not always available but I mean if something comes up and you just need to mull
something over, you know, I'm there for you." He was still feeling left out of
her inner life but less so than before.
Betty nodded and thanked him. But they had the evening to talk but usually by 
then her time for reflection had passed.

After a relaxing Saturday and Sunday weekend with Steve, Betty started another
week on leave another week-weekend as she was calling it. She decided that in 
that second week she would call Steve during the day at some point in order to
keep him in the loop. In fact she called him the very next day. It was more of
the same slighly political state of society reflections that she'd been having.
Steve was slightly tired of these ideas before and were sort of subversive ideas
that most students have when they're at university and promptly forget when they
land their first job. They had a good life and they had a good family and even 
though it was interesting to talk about these things he couldn't see that they
were in any way relevant to his or her life and he couldn't see that either of
them would make any changes based on those discussions. Which of course begged
the question why even have them? Why talk this stuff if it didn't lead to any
course of action? Steve wasn't much of an ideas guy it seemed. He liked to 
discuss things only as a means of reaching a conclusion. He couldn't see any
other point to a discussion. He was willing to listen to someone when they 
needed an ear but again this was in line with his code that it was leading to a
logical end point i.e. the person would feel better as a result of unloading 
their burden. But talking about an idea purely to discuss it and develop it 
seemed a little indulgent. Betty knew this of course and had spared him on many
occassions but as he had asked to be kept in the loop she complied. She figured
that if she didn't call him the rest of the week to keep him updated then he 
wouldn't mind for fear that she would again ask him to listen to her political
cum philosophical ideas. He wasn't interested and he was also against them. He
wasn't going to start arguing against her and make a big thing of it so Betty
felt safe to continue her week-weekend on her own. Even though these ideas were
of no interest to Steve and she'd thrown them at him as a means of leaving her
alone, she herself did find them important and interesting. Why did they keep
coming up? Why was she questioning her way of living? After her run she went to
the same coffee shop that week and sat with her newspaper to enjoy her brunch.
She was always alone although one of her colleagues did come and join her one
day for a brief interlude. They weren't friends outside of work but they did 
have a connection of sorts. Betty told her that she'd be back the following week
and that she was doing OK. She knew this would get back to the office and that 
even though this so called friend did genuinely mean well and offered support 
she was in fact snooping and actually wanted to see Betty more upset than she
was. Betty needed to show her that she wasn't some total blubbering wreck but at
the same time that she was suffering and that she did find the loss difficult, 
which she did of course but in spite of it all, in spite of the grief, she was
still fit for work. The department was downsizing and some of her contemporaries
were already out. Anyone could be next and someone who wasn't up to the job was
the most likely candidate. It would be cruel blow delivered with a smile and 
most of her colleagues wouldn't see it coming but she needed to stay ahead of
the game. Even though Betty's colleague had come to assess Betty, Betty also 
had the opportunity to assess the state of affairs at the office and her 
department. It seemed that if she wanted to keep her job then she would have
to return the following week ready or not.

Once her colleague had left she continued with the newspapers for a little while
as it was a good way to reflect without seeming that that was what you were 
doing. You could stare at an article appearing to be reading it but really taking
your mind elsewhere. It was once again about life, work and social obligations
and how many of her goals were actually her own and how many were seeds that had
been planted by society and had now matured into fully fledged desires. Did she
want children or did society want her to have children? But as Steve was saying,
why even take the time to consider any of these things if there was no end result?
She wasn't going to change job, change her lifestyle, give up on the idea of 
having a family or getting married. Or was she? Steve wasn't worried but he asked
anyway one day. Of course she wasn't but she just couldn't understand why she 
was compelled to think about it. But she also thought about Steve's philosophy
that was essentially about appreciating what he had never taking it for granted.
She concluded that if he was appeciating what he had then he didn't want anything
else. This somehow seemed a bit of a narrow view to her. She viewed her own 
situation as fake having had these reflections for almost two weeks and in a way
Steve's philosophy was reinforcing her ideas that society strives to maintain the
status quo. It creates a set of norms and then each of its members supports all
attempts to maintain those norms and challenges all attempts to change it. He 
was grateful for what he had and realised that it could be taken away at any time.
But was he truly happy with what he had? He still had his life when many others
were dead. He still had his partner when many didn't. He had a good job and one
which he enjoyed. He had a bright future ahead and all of this pleased him a 
great deal. But it was as though he hadn't chosen any of these things himself. 
He had been presented with them and he had accepted. He hadn't looked within his
soul to find out who he was and what he really wanted from life. He had settled
for comfort and convenience and had no time for his soul. At least that was how
Betty saw it. She hadn't been one for looking within herself but lately she didn't
need to do that, the within was making its way without. She merely needed to sit
back and observe. It made her question every aspect of her life and her reason 
for doing all of the things that she did. She needed more time to explore these
ideas both on a personal level and also on a universal one. But if she wanted to
keep her job then it was time to close this chapter and get back to the facts 
and figures of the banking world. Perhaps that was why people weren't allowed to
take long breaks in case they started to think about life and then quit work.
