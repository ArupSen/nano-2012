The period immediately following Anne's death. Betty is allowed one week by her
employer. This scene takes us up to the first hospital visit.
WC - 

Betty spent the rest of her week off doing much the same as that Monday. She 
started the day with a long bath followed by a run, breakfast in the park or in
a nearby cafe and some shopping on the way home. She had been given one week of 
paid leave and her boss had been kind enough to allow her to take more time if
she needed as unpaid leave or use some of her holiday allowance. Stocks had taken
a dive and she was wondering if this compassion was just a front to sweeten the
blow when it came to letting her go. She was a good worker but there were many 
like her where she worked: perhaps it was time to trim the fat. She was required
but not indispensible. She hadn't reached that level of responsibility just yet.
She was close but not close enough. The last time she'd had a break like this was
when she was at university, having the whole day to herself and deciding when she
would do what. It took a little discipline on her part but the rewards were worth
it so long as she didn't get too distracted. The day was a small unit of your 
whole life and if you could steer your way through the day doing what you wanted
and creating an atmosphere that was conducive to the way you saw the world then 
that was a day lived well. If the rest of your days could be like that then that
was a good result. Betty wondered why these were the only times when people with
regular jobs and careers got time off like this. When they were sick or when they
had children or a bereavement. They had paid holiday time of course but that 
usually entailed going off to some other destination to get away from the usual
day to day and enjoy the luxury of something that couldn't be had at home. It 
then involved coming home and sharing those tales with friends and colleagues. 
But the main activity of life was work with only a few short interludes. Even 
weekends involved doing home admin, housework and a little social interaction. 
It was often social obligation rather than purely fun. How about a week that was
an extension of a weekend she thought. Going to the museum, the cinema and taking
time reading the newspaper at a cafe. The kinds of things that most people did 
at the weekend but repeated over a whole week. Three weekends in a row. After the
activities were exhausted of interest they would become vehicles to create a 
sense of structure and routine now that there was no 9-5 work period to give that
structure. And once the activities became banal and empty then the real yearning
that underlies our day to day can come up to the surface and we have time to
examine it in a controlled environment called the week-weekend. A mini sabbatical
if you like where we can gauge our own plans and desires against that of the 
collective. Do we fit the profile of the American dream? Do we really want kids,
better career and a family life? People in better paid jobs can look down on 
those that work on the factory floor and rejoice in the fact that they are not
thoughtless automatons working from hand to mouth and locked in a state of affairs
where no amount shifting the goal posts can change their situation. They had 
enough money to enjoy a certain amount of leisure and to consume luxury goods
but that still meant being tied to their career. They were valued workers hired
for their skills and trusted with decisions. But even though they were higher up
the scale than the average labourer they were still only a small part of something
that was much bigger and needed to be kept silent. The better pay, the access to 
more affluent leisure pursuits and the ability to live in sought after location
all made it seem to them that they had made something of their lives but were 
they just part of a collective over which they had very little control?

Betty allowed these thoughts come up in her mind and tried not to accept or reject
them while she spent her week creating a week-weekend for herself. She wondered
if new mothers spent their days in this way but looking after the baby would take
up all or most of their time. I guess a nanny would help she thought. After her
run and cafe for brunch, newspapers and reflection she would get a few things for
the evening meal and take her time preparing it. This wasn't something that she 
did in the past even at the weekend but she was enjoying and Steve was appeciating
it too.
