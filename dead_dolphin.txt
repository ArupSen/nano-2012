A dead dolphin has washed up on the beach one day.

Betty, Alex and Rufus are all at the cafe on the beach having their breakfast
and looking out to sea. It's a little chilly and there is a breeze blowing the
sand but they have dutifully come to their usual spot to take their breakfast.
Alex grins at them before announcing that he's had a dream that he'd like to
share.
"Oh god Alex, do we have to share our dreams as well?" sighed Betty. "I'm not
sure if I can deal with this so early in the morning."
"Betty, come on", said Rufus, "this sounds like a corker. He knows what you're
like about all that bollocks. I'm a bit skeptical too as it happens unless I've
had a wee dram or two."
Alex took a sip of his tea and decided to put more sugar into it. 
"Banana fucking porridge again", he said, "drives me mad it does. But then it's
part of this whole experience isn't it."
It was a rhetorical question and they sensed it was his way of taking the stage
and recounting his dream. They all stared out to sea before turning back to the
table as if it was a micro prayer and they were offering this story to the sea.

Betty stirred her tea and took a sip and turned to Alex with an slight upward
nod. He grinned again and swallowed another mouthful of porridge. 
"It was so real man, it was like I was there, I mean here. In my dream I was
here on the beach but it was a bit of a grey day, a bit like back home. And
there was this guy pulling a boat out of the sea. Just a small rowing boat but
it was heavy. I mean it looked heavy. I asked if I could give him a hand and
he was well pleased. So we both pulled in this boat which was much heavier 
than it looked. He wouldn't let me look inside it but I was quite insistent
so he gave in in the end. The waves were lapping up and gently rocking the 
boat and I could see something moving inside. There was some blue plastic
tarp covering whatever was in there and I could smell it more than I could 
see it. The guy shrugged his shoulders and made a gesture that I should look
underneath it so I did. And lo and behold it was you two! I mean I was so
gobsmacked that I almost fell backwards. I couldn't really figure out if you
were dead or if you were sleeping. There were fish in the boat too so I guess
the smell was coming from there. But I couldn't figure it out. The guy could 
see that I couldn't figure it out and so he grinned at me as though he was 
about to tell me but he didn't. He just carried on grinning and shrugged his
shoulders again. I was just about to shake you to see if you were sleeping
or dead when more boats started turning up on the beach with their boatman
coming out to pull it ashore. As I started looking up and down the shore to
see the boats being pulled in I saw the man grinning again. I suppose he was
thinking like, should I tell this guy or let him figure it out for himself.
And that was it really. Got a bit hazy after that."
