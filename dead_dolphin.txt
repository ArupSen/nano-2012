A dead dolphin has washed up on the beach one day.

Betty, Alex and Rufus are all at the cafe on the beach having their breakfast
and looking out to sea. It's a little chilly and there is a breeze blowing the
sand but they have dutifully come to their usual spot to take their breakfast.
Alex grins at them before announcing that he's had a dream that he'd like to
share.
"Oh god Alex, do we have to share our dreams as well?" sighed Betty. "I'm not
sure if I can deal with this so early in the morning."
"Betty, come on", said Rufus, "this sounds like a corker. He knows what you're
like about all that bollocks. I'm a bit skeptical too as it happens unless I've
had a wee dram or two."
Alex took a sip of his tea and decided to put more sugar into it. 
"Banana fucking porridge again", he said, "drives me mad it does. But then it's
part of this whole experience isn't it."
It was a rhetorical question and they sensed it was his way of taking the stage
and recounting his dream. They all stared out to sea before turning back to the
table as if it was a micro prayer and they were offering this story to the sea.

Betty stirred her tea and took a sip and turned to Alex with an slight upward
nod. He grinned again and swallowed another mouthful of porridge. 
"It was so real man, it was like I was there, I mean here. In my dream I was
here on the beach but it was a bit of a grey day, a bit like back home. And
there was this guy pulling a boat out of the sea. Just a small rowing boat but
it was heavy. I mean it looked heavy. I asked if I could give him a hand and
he was well pleased. So we both pulled in this boat which was much heavier 
than it looked. He wouldn't let me look inside it but I was quite insistent
so he gave in in the end. The waves were lapping up and gently rocking the 
boat and I could see something moving inside. There was some blue plastic
tarp covering whatever was in there and I could smell it more than I could 
see it. The guy shrugged his shoulders and made a gesture that I should look
underneath it so I did. And lo and behold it was you two! I mean I was so
gobsmacked that I almost fell backwards. I couldn't really figure out if you
were dead or if you were sleeping. There were fish in the boat too so I guess
the smell was coming from there. But I couldn't figure it out. The guy could 
see that I couldn't figure it out and so he grinned at me as though he was 
about to tell me but he didn't. He just carried on grinning and shrugged his
shoulders again. I was just about to shake you to see if you were sleeping
or dead when more boats started turning up on the beach with their boatman
coming out to pull it ashore. As I started looking up and down the shore to
see the boats being pulled in I saw the man grinning again. I suppose he was
thinking like, should I tell this guy or let him figure it out for himself.
And that was it really. Got a bit hazy after that." 

"Fuck man, hope that's not a premonition or anything", said Rufus opening his
eyes wide.
"So you didn't figure out if we were dead or sleeping?" asked Betty.
"I guess not", said Alex.
"That's deep man", said Rufus with a long sigh."At least, it means something
I guess".
"It doesn't mean anything. I wouldn't read anything into it", said Betty 
shaking head. "It's just nice to know that we figure in your dreams and that
you care enough to tell us about it but other than that there isn't anything
deep and meaningful to take from it."
"Always the skeptic eh. I'll tell you what it means", said Alex finishing his
final spoonful of porridge. "It means that I'm going to look after you if 
you're asleep or dead. I was here first and you both came afterwards and now
we're travelling together. Well, we hang out a lot together. And the boatman
is the hand of fate who can see that we go well together so decided to put
us together. Yeah, think that's my basic interpretation."
"Go Alex. Put on some gypsy earrings and tell us our fortune while you're at
it. You seem to know your stuff." Betty was being sarcastic but she was also
getting a little irritated. She was still new to all this New Age mumbo jumbo
and psychological nonsense as she called it. She took another gulp of her tea
and pushed back her chair to get up. 
"I'm going down to watch the waves. You guys coming?" Betty picked up her bag
and mat and wandered toward the shore.
"Alex man, you pissed her off", said Rufus.
"Nah, she's alright, probably something on her mind and doesn't want to 
listen to my bollocks." Alex took a gulp of tea. "Shall we go and join her?"

As they walked the few feet from the cafe to the shore they could see people
staring out to sea and lots of people coming closer to the shore and 
pointing. Betty stood up to see what was happening and exchanged glances
with Alex and Rufus. Each made a slight shrug. Then people higher up the 
bank grew more ardent with their pointing while other craned their necks and
squinted their eyes. There was something floating towards the beach from the
horizon. From a distance it looked like one of those inflatable lifeboats but
was orange. As it came closer there was a distinct waft of rotting flesh. Now
they could see that it wasn't orange but more orange and grey. Some came even
closer to the shore while others moved away. The object was gradually being 
washed closer and closer to the shore and drifting into where Alex had had 
his dream about the boat carrying Betty and Rufus. They both looked at him.
"Nostra fuckin' damus mate", said Rufus.
Betty clutched her nose to avoid the stink. She picked up her things and 
started to wander away from the shoreline. 
"What is it?", asked Alex, not to anyone in particular. There was a fisher-
man standing near them who recognised it immediately. 
"It's a dolphin. Probably been dead a few days. Sometimes they get washed up
on the beach. It's quite a big one."
The decaying mass soon washed up onto the beach and now most of the onlookers
stepped further and further away. The braver among them went for the closer
look. The fisherman went to call for help and have it removed. Once the 
curiosity value was over it could be detrimental to the tourist trade so the 
sooner the better.
"Don't think I'm going to swim today." said Betty.
"Rotten dolphin flesh is great for exfoliating the skin. Better than Dead Sea
mud any day." said Rufus.
"Yeah? Why don't you try it then?" said Betty. "Think I might go for a run. 
Up for a run?" She looked at both of them in turn as she asked.
"But what about the dream? It means something now doesn't it?" said Rufus.
"Drop it mate, let's leave it for today. I'm sorry I mentioned it now", said
Alex looking dejected.
"Don't mind me. You can't stop being yourself just to please me. If we're 
planning to travel together and spend more time together then we gotta have 
these things out. I really don't want us to be changing our ways to fit. We're
not at work and we're not trying to please our bosses here. we're free aren't 
we? At the forefront of our lives with no plans and no destination in mind."
Betty need to reassure them that even though the hippy stuff did irritate her
she was willing to put up with it as it was the culture of most travellers.
"Cheers, Mrs." said Rufus. Alex nodded in agreement.
"I can see you're not interested in a run, so I'll catch you guys later. I 
won't be too long. Maybe we can take a trip further down the beach where
the water is a bit cleaner. Arambol perhaps? I don't fancy the flea market
crowd today." She raised a hand and walked off toward her hut.

Rufus and Alex went back to the cafe for another tea and saw a truck arrive
to remove the dead dolphin. It didn't take them long to clean up and soon it
was as though nothing had happened. They sipped their tea and looked out to
sea.
