Betty finally arrives at Trudy's place near Santa Rosa
WC - 620

After three days on the road across the USA Betty finally arrived at Trudy's 
place. It didn't take her long to drive from Sacramento to Santa Rosa but then
it was tricky route from there to Trudy's house. Her house was almost on the 
beach, a wooden house with one storey which resembled a dilapided shack from a
distance. Betty had to drive her car right to end of the tarmaced road to reach
Trudy's house. She was a little worried about the rental car. It felt to remote
even though Santa Rosa was only a few minutes drive away. It was around 11.00 
when Betty arrived and Trudy was sitting out on the porch with mug of hisbiscus
tea looking out to sea. She was wearing a thick woolen sweater and holding the 
cup in the ends of the sleeves. Trudy had freckles and very long strawberry
blond hair that was nearly always tied up in a plait. She turned when she heard
the car approaching and put her tea down onto the wooden table. Betty hadn't 
described the car to her so she waited till she could see the driver. They had
always remained in contact since they were at uni together but they hadn't 
sent each other photos. Letters and phonecalls are one thing but meeting in 
person can be quite an eye opener. Trudy recognised Betty at once. She smiled
as though this visit had happened many times before and started to walk towards
the car.

Trudy was wearing tight black legging with grey stripes and walking boots. She
was almost stomping across the sandy soil towards Betty. Betty stopped the car
and sat there looking at Trudy walking towards her. Betty had more trouble 
recognising Trudy than Trudy did of Betty. She was not how she had remembered
her. Her face looked familiar but her style had changed a great deal. It was 
as though someone had dressed up to look like Trudy or someone who looked like
Trudy had dressed in their own way. While Betty thought this over Trudy had 
arrived at the car and was knocking at the drivers door window. Betty started
to open the door and Trudy helped her pull it all the way open. Betty got out
and they just hugged. A long easy hug that said all they could have said by
way of greeting. As they pulled apart Betty caught hold of Trudy's plait and
examined it.
"Wow, that's quite something. How long is it? I mean in years."
Trudy wasn't going to be starting a conversation right there next to the car.
She took it as a rhetorical question and asked Betty to get her bags and then 
go inside. Trudy helped with the bags and they trudged under the weight of the
luggage over to the beach house. When they were inside Betty was still worried
about the hire car.
"Is my car going to OK here? Well, actually it's not my car it belongs to Hertz
which is all the more reason for me to be extra careful."
"It'll be fine. You see some couples, some joggers and dog walkers of course.
But it's unlikely that someone would come here to steal a car or cause any
damage. It's safe. Don't worry."
As a way to reassure her further Trudy showed Betty to the room where she'd be
staying and through the window she would be able to see the car. The other 
window looked out to sea which is the one that would prove to be more important
once felt more comfortable there.

Once Betty's luggage was inside she and Trudy went into the kitchen and waited
for the water to boil. Betty opted for coffee while Trudy had another cup of 
hibiscus tea. They walked out onto the porch where there were large bamboo 
armchairs with dirty looking white cushions. As Betty was looking for somewhere
to set down her coffee she felt something pressing against her from behind. She
imagined it might be some kind of furniture and turned to see what it was. She
jumped a little and put her hand to her heart when she realised what it was. 
Trudy giggled when she saw what had happened. 
"This is Benjy", said Trudy, "he's harmless and sleeps most of the time. We go
for a little walk once a day. That's his spot right there".
She pointed to his rug. He was big shaggy Red Setter more of a copper than a red
and extremely calm. Having greeted Betty he promptly found his way to his rug 
and sat down to look out to sea and occassionally turning to look at Betty.
"So, here you are at last", said Trudy.
"Here I am", said Betty.
"Gosh, how long has it been?"
"Too long. Sure is good to see you."
They sat down properly and got comfortable. Trudy moved the table a little so 
that they could both reach it easily. They each took a sip of their hot drink
looked at each other and smiled. The sun was well up in the sky as it was mid-
morning but it was still hazy. Some sea mist still around and along with a slight
wind the sound of sea birds. Betty snuggled deeper into her armchair: she had
arrived and it was time to relax. She flicked the lock of hair that was coming
across her face and took another sip of her coffee.
"I can't believe your hair - it's so long. Has it been growing all this time?"
Betty wanted to launch into stuff that was going on with her but she didn't want
to seem rude or selfish. But there was a strong yearning to let it all out.
Trudy laughed because she could see Betty was fidgeting and aching to talk about
her life and what was meaningful to her.
"What's funny? asked Betty looking around.
"You are." laughed Trudy "I'm sorry, but you drove out all this way just to talk
about my hair? Betty, come on, it's me. You don't need to that small talk shit.
Just let it out. You're here now and I'm listening. Tell me everything".
Betty was stunned and opened her eyed wide. She made a shy smile.
"Am I that easy to read?" asked Betty.
"Uh huh", nodded Trudy. "But just give me the highlights for now as I've got a
client coming in half an hour or so."
"Client?" asked Betty knitting her brows.
"Oh, didn't I tell you? I do massage. Well it's kind of a massage. It's called
Shiatsu and I do acupuncture treatments too. Gotta pay the rent." She said with
a turn of the head.
"This guy is a long term client, he's been coming for about three years I guess.
He was in a car accident and was OK in terms of injuries, I mean nothing too 
serious but he was reliving it all over again. Like having nightmares and visions
and all that shit. Doctor gave him drugs but that kind of made things worse in a
way. He said the pills just made everything feel flat. I mean his nightmares all
stopped but he didn't feel anything at all. Just no ups and downs. Must be so 
many people going through the same shit. Anyway, someone recommended me to him
and he came along to give it a try and three years later he's still coming. He's
fairly well off and has a busy job so he often cancels last minute but still pays
me, which is cool."
"So you didn't do anything with your degree?" asked Betty.
"I did for a while, you know, same as you but uh, things changed. California 
being what it is and all the alternative lifestyles that we follow here. It was
easy to be influenced by that. I was going to yoga classes and one of my friends
there was having acupuncture treatment so I thought I'd give it a try. After Gary
died it was pretty tough being here on my own."
"Right. How long ago was that?" asked Betty.
"About five years ago I guess. Yeah. But soon after that I was hooked to this 
treatment. I mean totally. Like I was back at college all over again. I suppose
that after Gary was gone I needed something to put myself into, something that
was wholesome and nourishing. It's been amazing. I'm doing something that I love
doing and I have this great lifestyle. I was a little scared at first being here
on my own but I feel much better now."
"Wow, that's amazing. I want to know more about it. I mean I've just been 
wondering where my own life is going and you're just so ahead of me on that
score." Betty seemed in awe of Trudy's life.
"It's taken a while but I've had some great support out here. I've got my yoga
and meditation group, my acupucture friends and my Taekwondo friends". 
"Taekwondo?", asked Betty, "what, you do martial arts too? You're like totally
Eastern mystic. You've turned into a hippy".
"Well, yes and no. It wasn't like I got membership to the hippy club or anything
like that. And I'm still very skeptical about a lot of that pseudo esoteric stuff
that some of the people talk but what I've explored so far is entirely based on
my own experience. The acupunture gave me my energy back and the Taekwondo gave 
me my confidence back. I didn't swallow any doctines you know, I tried stuff out
and have kept the things that worked." Trudy didn't mind being called a hippy 
but she didn't like the idea of everything alternative being dumped into that
category. Betty stopped being sarcastic and nodded in agreement. Then she 
shrugged.
"Sorry, I didn't mean it that way." said Betty.
"I know, I was the same. And I wouldn't call myself a hippy but from where you're
sitting I look like a hippy by anyones standards. But hey, I'm in California so
I can be as hippy as I want." She said smiling.
"Well, good for you". Said Betty.
The phone rang and Trudy got up to go and answer it. She came back a minute later.
"He's cancelled so I'm free for the rest of the day. What shall we do? You hungry?
You want to grab a bite some place?" asked Trudy.
"Sure", nodded Betty.
"I know a place that does great seafood just a little way along the beach. I feel
like a walk. How about we take Benjy and take a stroll along the beach?"
"Sounds great. I wanna hear more about your life. It's so different to anyone I 
know in New York." Betty had almost forgotten about her own troubles and why she
had gone there in the first place. 
"You need to get changed or are you ready like that?" asked Trudy eager to get
going.
"I'm good. I just need to get my purse." Betty jumped out of her seat and went
into her new room for a moment. She looked at the room for a moment and let her
eyes rest on some of the ornaments. There was a windchime and a dreamcatcher.
"OK, I'm ready", said Betty, raising her hands. Trudy took the dog lead from its
hook and Benjy got up immediately and shook himself and stretched. Trudy put the
lead on his collar and locked the door. They walked on to the beach and close to
the shore where the sand was a bit firmer. A little further along their route 
she let Benjy off the lead and he ran on ahead chasing the birds. Trudy grabbed
a piece of driftwood and threw it. He ran after it and returned with it in his
mouth. Trudy patted his head and threw the wood again. This time it was lost in
the surf. He snuffled around for it but it was washed away. He didn't really 
want to get wet so didn't follow it into the sea to try and retrieve it. He was
happy just to run alongside them as they continued to stroll. 

The sound of the sea was very calming along with the space. They could see the
horizon and the bay stretched back a long way from the shore giving a sense of
open space. There were some people jogging and there was a small group fishing
but otherwise the beach was deserted. Betty took a deep breath and found herself
settling into what would be her life for the next couple of weeks.
"So tell me about this Thai kun do", said Betty, "is it like Kung Fu or something?
I saw Bruce Lee does something called Jeet Kune do. Is is like that?"
"It's Taekwondo." corrected Trudy, "No, not Kung Fu. It's more like Karate but 
has more kicking. I did try some other ones but I liked this one the best."
She was sad thinking about Gary and how he died.
"I've been training pretty hard so I'll be doing that a couple of times a week.
You can come along if you like", suggested Trudy encouragingly.
"What and get my ass whipped", said Betty.
"It's not like that", chuckled Trudy, "if the sensei beat up all the new people 
he'd have a pretty small class you know."
"But I've never done it before. Can I just watch?", asked Betty.
"They don't like people watching. You can just join the beginners group. Lots of
moms and kids there too."
"Great, I'll get beat up by a kid".
"Come on Betty, it'll be fun. But if you really don't want to come that's cool.
You can hang here or whatever really. But you'll get to see it first hand."
"OK, I'll give it a shot." said Betty reluctantly. Trudy laughed again and put
her arm through Bettys. They walked a little faster.
"So when are going to tell me what's going on? Why all the mystery?", said Trudy.
"I guess I'm not really sure what's going on. I have an idea but I just needed
some time to think about it and get away from my normal life."
"OK. You guys in New York were hit pretty hard with the Trade Center attacks and
your sister died. I was real sorry to hear that. But you're about to get married.
I mean doesn't that kind of balance things? Like, lots of shit has happened but
now you got something real nice coming up. So my guess is that whatever this 
thing might be is not a good thing. I'm guessing it's another shitty thing that's
hit you pretty hard and it's just one too many. Am I right?" said Trudy.
She felt Betty's arm tighten against hers and turned towards her to see the tears
flooding down her face. They stopped walking and Betty let go of the deepest most
guttaral sobs she had cried. Something inside of her told her that it was a safe
place and she could finally be totally open. She let go of Trudy's arm and feel
to her knees. Her movements were convulsive and all Trudy could do was reach down
and stroke her back. She didn't try and stop her or say anything or try and lift
her up but allowed her the time she needed to experience her cathartic tears.
Betty couldn't remember ever crying like that. It was long and intense and without
reserve. When the spell had passed she came to her senses and found herself 
kneeling on the sand and looking around her. For a moment she didn't know where
she was and just looked out to sea. Then she remembered. She felt a little 
embarrased and wiped her tears with her sleeve. She looked up and let Trudy help
her up.
"Oh god, I'm really sorry. I really wasn't expecting that. I don't think I've ever
cried like that. Shit. That was intense", she said trying to make light of it.
"I was right wasn't I? You got the mob after you?" she asked squinting.
Betty laughed out loud and threw back her head. She took Trudy's arm again and 
they continued to walk and soon came upon a small harbour with a few boats and
lots of birds flying around. They joined a path that lead away from the shoreline
towards the harbour. There was a building with flaking red paint and very large
windows. It had tables outside which weren't occupied and some occupied tables
inside. This was Captain Joe's seafood diner. It was like a typical diner but 
they specialised in seafood dishes. 
"Hey Joe, got my friend Betty visiting. Can we get a couple of platters. How you
doin'?" said Trudy as she opened the door for Betty.
"Hey Trudy," said Joe a skinny grey haired old man dressed in an apron and chef's
hat. "You guys want drinks?".
"A coke" said Trudy glancing at Betty who nodded," make that two".
They found a table by a window and Benjy curled up under the table.
"You're gonna love this place", said Trudy,"I don't come here all the time but
pretty often. It's not too expensive and the food is always great. Really fresh
and unadulterated. So, it's pretty big then whatever it is."
"Yeah, I guess it is."
"Well, you tell me when you're good and ready. No pressure. But I'm here for you.
You know that right. That's why you came." Trudy reached out and pressed Betty's
arm.
It wasn't long before their platters arrived. Big plates laden with a mix of all
the local seafoods. Joe served them himself to come and say hello to Betty. He
went through and explained each of the items on the plate and invited Betty to 
come at anytime. As Joe left the table Betty reached for a battered prawn and 
dipped it in the sauce. The firm texture of the meat coupled with the tartness
of the sauce made sense to her palette and she chewed slowly to savour the 
experience.
"Huh? What did I tell you." said Trudy congratulating herself.
Betty nodded in agreement and reached for another one. Then some squid, mussels
and scallops. There were handmade fries to accompany the dish which they both
devoured within minutes.
"You want to hang here or shall we go back?" asked Trudy. Betty liked the peace
and tranquility of the place but she was ready to open her heart to Trudy and 
this wasn't the place to do it.
"This one's on me OK? No, no, no arguments." Trudy pushed back Betty's hand as 
she attempted to put down a note. She caught Joe's eye and waved a note and she
indicated that she was leaving it on the table. They got up to leave and Joe 
wished them goodbye and to come again. Betty liked him and imagined herself going
there again on her own. As they walked along the track back to the shoreline 
Betty finally opened her heart.
"Trudy, I went to the hospital at the end of last month and had a mammogram. I 
think I have breast cancer. This one, the left one. I don't believe it though.
I mean I'm young. People over 55 have it and it's extremely rare in women below
the age of 40. It's a big shock, it really is. And I really don't know what to
do. So I came to you. There, that's the story. I knew you'd be able to listen 
without any kind of bias, so I'm in your hands".
"If you want to put yourself in my hand then let me give you a massage. I can get
a pretty good idea of your energy that way. Let's allow the food to settle a bit
and I'll give you a treatment: no charge of course."
"Wow. Thanks. Sounds fantastic."
