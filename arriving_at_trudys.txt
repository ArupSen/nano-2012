Betty finally arrives at Trudy's place near Santa Rosa
WC - 620

After three days on the road across the USA Betty finally arrived at Trudy's 
place. It didn't take her long to drive from Sacramento to Santa Rosa but then
it was tricky route from there to Trudy's house. Her house was almost on the 
beach, a wooden house with one storey which resembled a dilapided shack from a
distance. Betty had to drive her car right to end of the tarmaced road to reach
Trudy's house. She was a little worried about the rental car. It felt to remote
even though Santa Rosa was only a few minutes drive away. It was around 11.00 
when Betty arrived and Trudy was sitting out on the porch with mug of hisbiscus
tea looking out to sea. She was wearing a thick woolen sweater and holding the 
cup in the ends of the sleeves. Trudy had freckles and very long strawberry
blond hair that was nearly always tied up in a plait. She turned when she heard
the car approaching and put her tea down onto the wooden table. Betty hadn't 
described the car to her so she waited till she could see the driver. They had
always remained in contact since they were at uni together but they hadn't 
sent each other photos. Letters and phonecalls are one thing but meeting in 
person can be quite an eye opener. Trudy recognised Betty at once. She smiled
as though this visit had happened many times before and started to walk towards
the car.

Trudy was wearing tight black legging with grey stripes and walking boots. She
was almost stomping across the sandy soil towards Betty. Betty stopped the car
and sat there looking at Trudy walking towards her. Betty had more trouble 
recognising Trudy than Trudy did of Betty. She was not how she had remembered
her. Her face looked familiar but her style had changed a great deal. It was 
as though someone had dressed up to look like Trudy or someone who looked like
Trudy had dressed in their own way. While Betty thought this over Trudy had 
arrived at the car and was knocking at the drivers door window. Betty started
to open the door and Trudy helped her pull it all the way open. Betty got out
and they just hugged. A long easy hug that said all they could have said by
way of greeting. As they pulled apart Betty caught hold of Trudy's plait and
examined it.
"Wow, that's quite something. How long is it? I mean in years."
Trudy wasn't going to be starting a conversation right there next to the car.
She took it as a rhetorical question and asked Betty to get her bags and then 
go inside. Trudy helped with the bags and they trudged under the weight of the
luggage over to the beach house. When they were inside Betty was still worried
about the hire car.
"Is my car going to OK here? Well, actually it's not my car it belongs to Hertz
which is all the more reason for me to be extra careful."
"It'll be fine. You see some couples, some joggers and dog walkers of course.
But it's unlikely that someone would come here to steal a car or cause any
damage. It's safe. Don't worry."
As a way to reassure her further Trudy showed Betty to the room where she'd be
staying and through the window she would be able to see the car. The other 
window looked out to sea which is the one that would prove to be more important
once felt more comfortable there.
